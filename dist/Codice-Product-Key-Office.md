If you see the error This product key has already been used when you enter your product key on www.office.com/setup or Microsoft365.com/setup, this means your product key has already been redeemed and is no longer needed.
 
I recently purchased a new computer, which came pre-installed with the "Click to Run" version of Microsoft Office 365. Our organization does not use Office 365, and instead, we use the full Office Standard version.
 
I uninstalled Office from the computer and attempted to install Office Standard using the "Office Deployment Tool 2021" executable. After a few seconds, it shows an error message that states it "Couldn't install". The code provided is "Error Code: 0-2054 (0)".
 
As an expert, we advise the retail users to go with retail editions which is actually safe. Because, you will own the product key and can link it to your personal account and you can also re-use the license if you change your computer.

However, I want to update Excel in order to install the Spanish language pack or whatever, and what happens is that Office is uninstalled and then the same error pops up, "can't install office in the current update channel" or something like that. How can I update office without further issues?
 
It asked me where to extract the files, ended up with 5 files, 4 were .xml's and one setup.exe, turns out all i needed to do was running the setup exe like this: "setup.exe /configure configuration-Office2021Enterprise.xml"
 
That was one of the xml files present, each for a different installation, like office 365 and the like. If the Office Deployment Tool doesn't ask you where to extract these files, search in temp folder.
 
Besides, I suggest you check the ODT tool, you can try **the latest one**. If you have used the latest version of ODT, it is recommended to try **the previous versions**, such as the one in April.

Thank you for your suggestion. I ended up getting on a support call with a Microsoft Tech, who convinced me to get a refund for Office 2021 Standard and go with Office 365. That wasn't my preference, but I was under a deadline and needed to get Office loaded on this machine.
 
I did tons of research on the Internet before posting here, and can see that many people are frustrated by this error. Some get it resolved and some end up doing exactly what I did. For a company like Microsoft, I frankly expect better.
 
The **Motion Picture Production Code** was a set of industry guidelines for the self-censorship of content that was applied to most motion pictures released by major studios in the United States from 1934 to 1968. It is also popularly known as the **Hays Code**, after Will H. Hays, president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) from 1922 to 1945. Under Hays's leadership, the MPPDA, later the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the Motion Picture Association (MPA), adopted the Production Code in 1930 and began rigidly enforcing it in 1934. The Production Code spelled out acceptable and unacceptable content for motion pictures produced for a public audience in the United States.
 
From 1934 to 1954, the code was closely identified with Joseph Breen, the administrator appointed by Hays to enforce the code in Hollywood. The film industry followed the guidelines set by the code well into the late 1950s, but it began to weaken, owing to the combined impact of television, influence from foreign films, controversial directors (such as Otto Preminger) pushing boundaries, and intervention from the courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court.[1][2] In 1968, after several years of minimal enforcement, the Production Code was replaced by the MPAA film rating system.
 
In the 1920s, Hollywood was rocked by a number of notorious scandals, such as the murder of William Desmond Taylor and the alleged rape of Virginia Rappe by popular movie star Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, which brought widespread condemnation from religious, civic and political organizations. Many felt that the film industry had always been morally questionable,[3] and political pressure was increasing, with legislators in 37 states introducing almost one hundred film censorship bills in 1921. In 1922, as they were faced with the prospect of having to comply with hundreds and potentially thousands of inconsistent, easily changed decency laws in order to show their films, the studios chose self-regulation as the preferable option, enlisting Presbyterian elder Will H. Hays, Postmaster General under former President Warren G. Harding and former head of the Republican National Committee,[4] to rehabilitate Hollywood's image. The move mimicked the decision that Major League Baseball had made in hiring judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis as League Commissioner the previous year to quell questions about the integrity of baseball in the wake of the 1919 World Series gambling scandal; *The New York Times* even called Hays the "screen Landis".[5] Hays was paid the lavish sum of $100,000 a year ($1.82 million in 2023),[6][7] and served for 25 years as president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA), where he "defended the industry from attacks, recited soothing nostrums, and negotiated treaties to cease hostilities".[6]
 
In 1924, Hays introduced a set of recommendations dubbed "the Formula", which the studios were advised to heed, and asked filmmakers to describe to his office the plots of films they were planning on producing.[8] In 1915, the Supreme Court had decided unanimously in *Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio* that free speech did not extend to motion pictures.[9] While there had been token attempts to clean up the films before (such as when the studios formed the National Association of the Motion Picture Industry (NAMPI) in 1916), little had come of the efforts.[10] New York became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the following year,[11] with eight individual states having a board by the advent of sound film,[12][13] but many of these were ineffectual. By the 1920s, the New York stage, a frequent source of subsequent screen material, had topless shows, performances filled with curse words, adult subject matter, and sexually suggestive dialog.[14] Early in the sound system conversion process, it became apparent that what was acceptable in New York might not be so in Kansas.[14] Filmmakers were facing the possibility that many states and cities would adopt their own codes of censorship, necessitating a multiplicity of versions of films made for national distribution. Self-censorship was deemed a preferable outcome.
 
In 1927, Hays suggested to studio executives that they form a committee to discuss film censorship. Irving G. Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Sol Wurtzel of Fox Film Corporation, and E. H. Allen of Paramount Pictures responded by collaborating on a list they called the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls", based on items that were challenged by local censor boards. This list consisted of eleven subjects best avoided and twenty-six to be handled very carefully. The list was approved by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Hays created the Studio Relations Committee (SRC) to oversee its implementation;[15][16] however, there was still no way to enforce tenets.[5] The controversy surrounding film standards came to a head in 1929.[17][18]
 
In a resolution passed on June 29, 1927, the MPPDA codified lists of "don'ts" and "be carefuls" into what they colloquially called their "Magna Charta".[19] Many of these would later become key points in the Code.[20]
 
"Special care [must be] be exercised in the manner in which the following subjects are treated, to the end that vulgarity and suggestiveness may be eliminated and that good taste may be emphasized":[19]
 
In 1929, Catholic layman Martin Quigley, editor of the prominent trade paper *Motion Picture Herald*, and Jesuit priest Father Daniel A. Lord, created a code of standards[21] and submitted it to the studios.[6][22] Lord was particularly concerned with the effects of sound film on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure.[21] In February 1930, several studio heads, including Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, met with Lord and Quigley. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors in adopting the Code was to avoid direct government intervention.[23] It was the responsibility of the SRC (headed by Colonel Jason S. Joy, a former American Red Cross Executive Secretary)[15][24] to supervise film production and advise the studios when changes or cuts were required.[25][26] On March 31, the MPPDA agreed it would abide by the Code.[27] The production code was intended to put a limitation on films which were distributed to a large audience, making it more difficult to appeal to all individuals in the audiences.[28]
 
The code was divided into two parts. The first was a set of "general principles" which prohibited a picture from "lowering the moral standards of those who see it", so as not to wrongly influence a specific audience of views including, women, children, lower-class, and those of
