Henry Mintzberg created five organizational configurations that act a framework to understand and design organizational structures. First of all, he stated that each configuration has following components :

Based on the importance of the components, coordinating mechanisms and design decisions (design of decision making, lateral linkages, superstructure and positions), five structural configurations were established:
 
**Simple Structure:** The major coordinating mechanism used here is direct supervision. The key component of the organization in this case would be the strategic apex, and vertical and horizontal centralization is incorporated in this configuration.
 
**Machine bureaucracy:** The coordinating mechanism here is standardization of work processes. The key component of the organization here would be the technostructure and limited horizontal decentralization is used.
 
**Professional bureaucracy:** Standardization of skills is the coordinating mechanism in this configuration. The operating core forms the key component and both vertical and horizontal decentralization is used.
 
**Adhocracy:** Mutual adjustment is the coordinating mechanism in this configuration. The support staff (in an administrative adhocracy) or the operating core (in an operating adhocracy) forms the key component. Selective decentralization is used in this case.
 
This Organizational Configuration is also referred to as the entrepreneurial organisation and is characterised by a flat structure and a heavy strategic top. This leads to direct supervision/ regulation of all work processes. There is no middle management. In many cases, this involves a starting business, in which the director has a hands-on mentality and wishes to have control over all processes. There is no formal structure (yet) and the standardised systems are missing. An entrepreneurial organisation is flexible and will professionalise over time, which shows in the configuration. Departments will arise and middle management with it.
 
Just like in bureaucracy, this configuration is characterised by many guidelines and procedures, but the employees are highly independent. The professional organisation employs many highly educated people and, as a result, the focus lies on the operational core. The end result might differ per professional; they are personally responsible for the result. However, the input is standardised. In most cases, these are organisations in the free professions such as law firms, notaries, consultancy firms, accountancy firms and universities. There is a high level of efficiency, but little control of the work. Consequently, professional organisations are difficult to change.

The divisional structure is also referred to as an organisation according to product layout and is characterised by various product groups under the guidance of one central head office. The focus lies on middle management and there is output standardisation. The divisional structure can mainly be found in large organisations that have developed lots of product groups over the years which they might market under different brand names. An organisation such as Shell is a typical divisional structure; oil, fuel, plastic, petrochemistry, etc. form the various product groups.
 
This concerns a decentralised structure, where each division has its own board. As a result, differences of opinion might arise between the divisions regarding the strategic course of the organisation. Due to the opposite interests between the divisions, it might be difficult to implement unambiguous changes.
 
The adhocracy is also termed an innovative organisation and is characterised by little fixed structure. Work is often done on a project basis with multi-disciplinary professionals. The focus lies on the supporting staff departments. Additionally, the adhocracy has characteristics from the first four configurations. Due to the innovative character, this organisation must be able to adapt, and sometimes strict measures are taken to achieve the desired end result.
 
**What do you think?** Do you recognize the Henry Mintzberg Organizational Configurations in your personal or professional environment? Do you recognize the practical explanation or do you have more suggestions? Which success factors can you share with the audience regarding organizational configurations and design?

Based on the strategy an organization adopts and the extent to which it is practiced, Mintzberg identified five organizational configurations. Each configuration reflects different factors (and indeed varying degrees of these factors) from the three dimensions outlined above.
 
These organizations have a simple, flat, and centralized structure with sometimes autocratic power. This power emanates from the strategic apex and control is exerted by a small but influential team headed by a CEO.
 
In a machine organization, work is formal and standardized with numerous routines and procedures. Decision-making is centralized, jobs are clearly defined, and procedures are routinely analyzed to improve efficiency.
 
Professional organizations rely on skills standardization rather than work processes or outputs to drive coordination. As a result, this structure is common in universities, hospitals, accounting firms, consultancy firms, and some tech companies.
 
While decision-making is decentralized at the divisional level, note that there is little coordination between the divisions themselves. This means that in some cases, each division may more closely resemble a machine bureaucracy if viewed in isolation.
 
Adhocracies utilize mutual adjustment as a means of coordination and maintain selective patterns of decentralization. Think of mutual adjustment as peers who are able to coordinate their own work and communicate with others.
 
This structure tends to be informal and with a small technostructure because specialists are also involved in core operations. Since the primary goal of an adhocracy is innovation and adaptation, tasks are non-routine and tend to be reliant on technology.
 
Picture a company with 20 people and a company with 200 people. How do you imagine each might operate? Would they have a similar organizational structure, or would there be different positions based on the size of the company? Maybe you pictured the company with 200 people to be more structured in responsibilities and knowledge. Following the organizational structure of a professional bureaucracy, this would certainly be the case.
 
Weber presented the concept of bureaucratic structures - among the existing organizational structures - as analogous to a machine: precise, fast, and unambiguous.3 He outlined how bureaucratic structures would have a certain degree of standardization and be better suited for more complex or larger administrations. Ultimately, there were three main characteristics for bureaucracies: clearly defined roles and responsibilities; respect for merit; and a hierarchical structure. In terms of hierarchy, bureaucracies would have people in different levels of the organization, with policies regulating the decision making and actionable powers afforded to individuals at each level. In other words, everyone would know and respect their place.
 
A Canadian academic working in the domains of business and management, Mintzberg has been appointed to the Order of Canada and the Royal Society of Canada for his contribution to organization theory.4 Specifically, his organizational configurations framework described five valid organizational configurations, outlining the coordination of tasks within each configuration and their basic parts.1 Mintzberg has also contributed to business strategy theories, emphasizing the strength of emergent strategy, which arises informally at any level in an organization, over deliberate strategy, which is determined consciously by top levels of management.5
 
While organizational change is difficult to install and maintain, the success of change processes depends partly on how organizations are structured.6 Many social policies such as mental health deinstitutionalization and school desegregation have been implemented through professional bureaucracies and through the cooperation of different, formalized stakeholders within the organization. Scholars have identified efficient strategic decision making as another advantage of professional bureaucracies, as individual committees are responsible for their respective areas and there are therefore fewer levels of people that need to approve decisions.7
 
Our interview with Olivier Sibony is available in both podcast and transcript versions. A researcher on decision making and strategic thinking, Sibony discusses organizational structures and makes a case for bureaucracy, all while acknowledging the loss aversion of businesses.
 
In this configuration, authority and control are concentrated in the hands of the founder or top-level manager. Communication is informal, and decision-making is swift. This configuration is most commonly found in startups or small businesses where flexibility and quick decision-making are crucial for survival.
 
The Machine Bureaucracy configuration is characterized by a highly formalized and mechanistic structure. In this configuration, organizations have a rigid hierarchy, with clearly defined roles and responsibil
