I was going to ask if anyone could identify that guitar. All I could make out in the video was "Yamaha" on the headstock. Pretty much everything on that stage was a Yamaha product. I couldn't identify the line array elements, but they're probably Yamaha, too. Wanna bet he's got a sweet endorsement deal? He was obviously a Strat guy in his early days. Except for his surfboard period.

Anybody else notice that his guitar tech was sitting beside him the whole time? At first, I was trying to figure out what instrument he was playing, then got a side shot of him tuning the other guitar and then handing it off. Usually, techs hide backstage and just run out when needed to swap instruments. I'm guessing that guy does way more than just tune guitars. He's probably a hotshot player himself, maybe even a luthier on the side. And still had to submit a resume along with 100 other people to get the gig.
 
Sure if you got all the bucks it takes for all that expensive gear. When you factor in everything including all the time it takes to route it all up for the show I get it You get an uncluttered , simple easy to maintain stage .
 
I believe that amp is his personal stage monitor and probably feeding FoH from a line out off the amp. I say that because there is no obvious microphone visible, and there is no cable plugged into the front panel where you'd normally plug in your guitar. In fact, the input jack seems to be covered with tape.

Plus every time he does a tone change it's from his pedalboard. When he switches guitars the tech, sitting next to said pedalboard, has already plugged it in. The Leslie is clearly an amp sim on the floor, possibly the same electronics used for all of his other tones.
 
(Part of the article is referenced and translated into English) "I mainly make distortion with MESA BOOGIE's TRIAXIS, before using the TRIAXIS I also used the Mark II, and when recording in LA I used the RECTIFIER and others, although they have a metal-ish image."
 
At the 2:56 mark in the video, Masayoshi Takanaka is observed utilizing a Suhr Badger 30 amplifier. The Suhr Badger 30 is known for its versatile tones and high-quality sound output. In this particular moment of the performance, Takanaka incorporates the Suhr Badger 30 into his setup, showcasing ...
 
in this video takanaka can bee seen using the godin on the water. i found no informations about witch nylon he used in his albums but it's easy to think about it since is one of the most used nylon-electric guitars.
 
What guitar amps follow in the footsteps of Marshall and Fender? Mesa/Boogie is probably the name that most people would mention. The MK series, with its first-class tone that transcended genres from Santana to Metallica, and the Rectifier series, which later came to describe the sound of modern heavy amps, are examples of the highly original and high-quality sound of Mesa Boogie amps. The MK series, with its first-class tones that transcended genres and were loved by people all over the world, and the Rectifier series, which has since come to define the sound of modern heavy music, are some of the best brands in the United States. The brand's uncompromising commitment to playability and sound quality, including the design of power amplifiers with a unique output structure known as "SimulClass," led to the creation of numerous one-of-a-kind models. In addition, they were the first to produce a 2-channel model with a clean/drive switch, which is said to be the first of its kind in the world. In this article, we will trace the history of Mesa/Boogie, focusing especially on the early MK series, and examine the uniqueness of its design.
 
Randall Smith, founder of Mesa/Boogie and designer of Mesa/Boogie amplifiers, began repairing and modifying amplifiers in the late 1960's. Born in San Francisco in the 1940's, his father was a clarinet player, and from an early age he became familiar with the sound of instruments, especially woodwinds. He was familiar with the sound of musical instruments, especially woodwinds, from an early age. As a young boy, he became interested in the cutting-edge vacuum tube audio circuitry of the day, and enjoyed building radios and other devices in a garage store owned by a neighborhood engineer. Thus, Randall Smith grew up with the sound of quality instruments and excellent engineering.
 
In the 1960s, during the heyday of rock and roll music, Fender had already become a major player in American music with its blackface amplifiers, and Marshall amplifiers were being developed in England. However, the role of the electric guitar in the music scene at that time was still the rhythm part, and most of the solo parts between songs were occupied by saxophones and other wind instruments. Many guitar players of the time wanted to be the center of lead playing, but suffered from a lack of sufficient gain and sustain. Fender amps, which were the mainstream at the time, were powerful for chord work, but it was difficult to get the extended, singing tone of a wind instrument, and Marshalls were not yet widely available in the United States. For this reason, master volume modifications were made to Fender amps, but it was still difficult to obtain a good lead tone.
 
In such a scene, Randall Smith, who was still in high school, naturally fell in love with rock 'n' roll. He played as a drummer (coincidentally, the same as Jim Marshall), but by this time he had already developed considerable engineering skills and was repairing amps for his bandmates. Eventually his repair skills became so well known that he and a friend opened a repair store in the San Francisco Bay Area. His store became a local sensation, and many musicians, including Jefferson Airplane and the Doobie Brothers, began to show up.
 
One day in 1969, out of mischievous curiosity, he decided that it would be fun to get an incredibly loud sound out of a small practice amp, so he installed a Fender Princeton amp with a large transformer and two 6L6 power tubes in it and built a Bassman circuit. A Bassman circuit with a large transformer and two 6L6 power tubes was built into the Fender Princeton amp. The baffle board was replaced and JBL 12-inch speakers were used for the speakers (the original baffle board that was removed was used for the doors of the workshop at the time, which was called Dog Yard). A customer happened to pass by, played it and said, "Shit man, that little things really Boogies ! This was the origin of the name "Boogie. The customer was Carlos Santana, who at that time was a big name in the music business.
 
Thanks to Santana, the Boogie/Princeton attracted a lot of attention, and Randall was inundated with orders for a considerable number of them. Randall built about 150 to 200 of the Boogie/Princeton, but because it was based on an old Fender amp, the supply was limited, and it became difficult to keep up with the ever-increasing number of requests. Randall therefore founded a company called Mesa Engineering and began to develop and manufacture original amplifiers. (The name Mesa was an idea that came to Randall from his side job as a handyman who needed a name for his car repair business...) ) Anyway, the first original amplifier was the Mesa/Boogie (like the Sony Walkman), of which about 3,000 units were manufactured. This is what we call MK-I in the later period.
 
This is how the MK-I appeared in 1972. One more pre-tube was added to the Princeton/Boogie model, which allowed for even more gain sustain; three volume configurations, Volume 1, Volume 2, and Master, provided a wide range of gain control. It is said to be the first model in the world to be equipped with a volume for gain increase. Even Marshall did not come out with a master until 1975, so it is not difficult to imagine how early this was. The 12-inch speaker was built into an enclosure made of koa, maple, and other luxurious hardwoods, giving it the appearance of a high-end instrument, something that had never been seen in guitar amplifiers up to that time. The singing tone and rich wood sound may have reminded Randall of the sound of the clarinet, which he had been familiar with since he was a child. It goes without saying that this was Carlos Santana's heyday, but with the rise of hard rock and the crossover movement, the lead guitar was becoming more and more central to the music scene. In Japan, many lead guitar players, such as Masayoshi Takanaka, were captivated by the extended tone of this model, and it went on to establish a worldwide reputation.
