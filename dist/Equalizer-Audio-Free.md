Sincere apologies in the delayed reply, when I said GTK3 I meant that in context of GTK3 CSD buttons. Additional GTK3 libraries may need to be installed on exclusively Qt-based desktops like KDE if those libraries were not already dependencies from other software.
 
The pulseaudio equalizer ladsp package worked for me in Kde Plasma. I installed it as described at the top of this post. Thanks for this tutorial! I am really happy with it, because especially youtube videos can be of horrendous sound quality, but with this system wide pulseaudio equalizer installed, even the worst sounding youtube can be tweaked easily.
 
If you do encounter an issue, since this software is from the Manjaro community repository you can file any problems you encounter here and hope for a response. Also, this software needs a new maintainer to carry the torch, so if anybody wants to try maintaining the software then lend your body to the cause of great audio for all so us brainlets can not think so hard about how to make Linux sound good.
 
**Edit**: Wow, also, funniest thing, I apparently posted a comment on this tutorial about a year ago I have since tried qpaeq, I did not have the same issues with it as I did with pulseaudio-equalizer-ladspa & pulseaudio-equalizer-gtk.
 
See funny enough on my Dell N1770 with a second-generation, barrel-bottom Intel Core i3 second-generation processor qpaeq on Ubuntu was absolute garbage. People on the Ubuntu MATE forums agreed with me about that, but I have stopped maintaining that thread there since I am pretty much done with Debian systems.
 
This is supposed to be a simplified GUI for general users to access professional audio plugins
professional users would use the audio plugins directly with very different GUI and controls
(see calf-studio-gear.org and Linux Studio Plugins Project)

Pulseaudio Equalizer (qpaeq) has been recommended to avoid for many years, back to archived forum, because it generally does not work well
pulseaudio-equalizer-ladspa has been discussed much more on here for many years and is favoured by many users

Hi all, I had this problem too, luckily I was able to fix it by setting the equalizer correctly in EE and PE. It was then that I decided to share my work on GitHub and well this is the repository: GitHub - p-chan5/EasyPulse: A set of HQ presets for Easy Effects. I decided to also include a stereo effect that sounds nice on headphones.
 
Knowing which is the most appropriate for you is difficult. However, I support both versions (the one using PulseAudio and the other using PipeWire). They both sound the same (far from the technical aspects).
 
It's being 2 months i have being using zorin i liked it very much. I like to listen high bass music while working the only thing i'm missing especially on wired headset the music quality very poor as compared to my previous windows exp. I'm Asus Tuf Fx504 its support DTS audio while i was on Windows 10.
 
Then as you can already see in my screenshot. Click on Equalizer, adjust the frequency sliders as need. You can turn on/off the equalizer, by putting a checkmark or removing checkmark, next to equalizer in the left side list.
 
When I install Poweramp Equalizer it processes audio for about 30 minutes and then it stops doing so. Also when I restart the phone, there is no more audio processing even though it is active and everything seems fine in the app settings and Audio Processing is enabled.
 
I have a Samsung M30S with a built in 9 band equalizer into Android (under Sounds and Effects in Settings) and installing Poweramp Equalizer deactivates the built in EQ but after a while this is reversed. Poweramp EQ stops processing audio but the internal EQ starts working again. There seems to be a conflict.
 
1. the Samsung equalizer is not related in any way to Poweramp Equalizer (it can work in parallel, it can be disabled, etc.). It won't affect Poweramp Equalizer, though parallel usage is not recommended (due to possible overloads/artefacts/latency).
 
3. due the way equalization works on Android, Equalizer will pick up player only if player started \_after\_ Poweramp Equalizer (as players send equalization "request" on their startup). If Samsung firmware prevented Equalizer from start, equalization won't work until you restart player.
(This doesn't affect "Advanced Player Tracking" where Equalizer is able to pickup player playback at any time).
 
@Mahendar Reddy Most likely whatever audio playing app you are using is not handling audio sessions normally, possibly creating a new session for each song. What audio app are you using, or does it affect multiple apps?
 
@vext01 regarding artifacts: some players properly reuse audio session - only one is needed for the whole player lifetime. Some devs unfortunately are not aware of the issue and their players constantly recreate sessions, causing the artifacts. (The fun part the session number is a global shared int32 and when it overflow system crashes).
 
Audio Equalizer is a lite extension that let you easily adjust audio settings (the balance between frequency components in an audio file) from a toolbar popup.There are several audios presets available to choose from in the preset list. For example, you can choose, pop, club, party, soft rock dance, or any other preset format for the audio stream. Please note that you can also define your format and then save it for later use in the toolbar popup. There is also a - reset - button to revert all changes to the factory setting.Note: this add-on has a Mono feature. Mono is an accessibility feature for people with hearing problems (i.e. deaf in one ear). When this feature is active, you will never miss a word or sound when you are listening to audio from headphones.To report bugs, please fill out the bug report form on the add-on's homepage ( -equalizer.html).
 
**Equalization**, or simply **EQ**, in sound recording and reproduction is the process of adjusting the volume of different frequency bands within an audio signal. The circuit or equipment used to achieve this is called an **equalizer**.[1][2]
 
The concept of equalization was first applied in correcting the frequency response of telephone lines using passive filters; this was prior to the invention of electronic amplification. Initially, equalization was used to compensate for the uneven frequency response of an electric system by applying a filter having the opposite response, thus restoring the fidelity of the transmission. A plot of the system's net frequency response would be a flat line, as its response at any frequency would be equal to its response at any other frequency. Hence the term *equalization*.
 
Later the concept was applied in audio engineering to adjust the frequency response in recording, reproduction, and live sound reinforcement systems. Sound engineers correct the frequency response of a sound system so that the frequency balance of the music as heard through speakers better matches the original performance picked up by a microphone. Audio amplifiers have long had filters or controls to modify their frequency response. These are most often in the form of variable bass and treble controls, and switches to apply low-cut or high-cut filters for elimination of low-frequency *rumble* and high-frequency *hiss* respectively.
 
Graphic equalizers and other equipment developed for improving fidelity have since been used by recording engineers to modify frequency responses for aesthetic reasons. Hence in the field of audio electronics the term *equalization* is now broadly used to describe the application of such filters regardless of intent. This broad definition, therefore, includes all linear filters at the disposal of a listener or engineer.
 
A **British EQ** or **British style equalizer** is one with similar properties to those on mixing consoles made in the UK by companies such as Amek, Neve and Soundcraft[4] from the 1950s through to the 1970s. Later on, as other manufacturers started to market their products, these British companies began touting their equalizers as being a cut above the rest. Today, many non-British companies such as Behringer and Mackie[5] advertise British EQ on their equipment. A British style EQ seeks to replicate the qualities of the expensive British mixing consoles.
 
Filtering audio frequencies dates back at least to acoustic telegraphy[6] and multiplexing in general. Audio electronic equipment evolved to incorporate filtering elements as consoles in radio stations began to be used for recording as much as broadcast. Early filters included basic bass and treble controls featuring fixed frequency centers, and fixed levels of cut or boost. These filters worked over broad frequency ranges. Variable equalization in audio reproduction was first used by John Volkman working at RCA in the 1920s. That system was used to equalize a motion picture theater sound playback system.[7][8]
 
The Langevin Model EQ-251A was the first equalizer to use slide controls.[*when?*] It featured two passive equalization sections, a bass shelving filter, and a pass band filter. Each filter had switchable frequencies and used a 15-position slide switch to adjust cut or boost.[9] The first true graphic equalizer was the type 7080 developed by Art Davis's Cinema Engineering.[*when?*] It featured 6 bands with a boost or cut range of 8 dB. It used a slide switch to adjust each band in 1 dB steps. Davis's second graphic equalizer was the Altec Lansing Model 9062A EQ. In 1967 Davis developed the first 1/3 oc
