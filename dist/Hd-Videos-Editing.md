Your systems have the minimum requirements for editing 4K. Minimum is not good or recommended and means you need to limit yourself heavily. High resolution (4K) is often usually the better choice (kind of depends on what you are doing with it). The 5.3K video is good for cropping and downscaling to 4K.
 
Regardless of the system strength, it is recommended to use Proxy and Preview Scaling features when working with higher than 1080p. For your systems, that is essential maybe even for HD editing. There is a tutorial on our Tutorials page about those features as well as Documentation - English pages here if you search by those feature names.
 
For the gopro videos you can plug in the memory card directly into your computer and copy both the .mp4 and .lrv file which is an already made proxy-like file and will be automatically loaded\* by Shotcut (when you enable proxy). You can then easily edit on these and export will use the high quality files.
 
I'm using Articulate 360 (Storyline, PC desktop version). Trying to embed videos onto a slide, then see the properties of said video and looking for some thoughts from you, the more experienced e-Learning community.
 
1. Insert --> Video --> Video from website
2. Paste in the embed code, generated from YouTube, Wistia, Stream, wherever.
3. SL automatically inserts a 5-second long placeholder which I can then expand to match the length of the video (if I want to use triggers at the end of the video)
4. It's several weeks later. I want to go back and see the embed code (or better yet, the website from which the embed code was generated) for the video I inserted last month to make sure it's applicable.
 
I've tried:
1. Just follow this article! Simply right-click on the 5-second long placeholder and look for the edit button. Nope, there isn't one. See attached screenshots.
2. Go up to the toolbar and click Video Tools --> Options. Nope, the Edit Video button is grayed out.
 
That article is for a video or anything embedded as a Web Object, but it sounds like you're adding in the video from a website. Those steps are outlined here. There isn't a way to edit/see the existing website address or URL there. You'll see that noted here.
 
Ah, my mistake. In hindsight, it actually makes sense that I can't edit a video in SL that came off Vimeo/YouTube. I'm going to get in the habit of changing the placeholder name to what the video is. Thanks a lot Ashley,
 
I updated the firmware to UI 6.1 today and had run into the same issue. It's whenever I try to trim any video and keep it as 1x speed. It's irritating especially when I'm traveling and taping a lot of short clips. Heard that the issue is sticking to those shorter shots, which is very common in social media... I'm totally stuck.
 
I have the same issue too since the update and I'm not happy with it because I noticed it while being on vacation. Usually I make many short videos and edit them immediately before I post them on Instagram but that's not possible now. I hope Samsung will fix this soon.
 
I've reported the issue also to the Samsung Studio app via Samsung App store. We shouldn't have to wait until a new firmware release but more of an app update. It's been bugging me the whole month as it doesn't quite allow me to trim videos.

Hey there, I'm new here and wanted to share my 2 cents. Editing R6 videos can be a pain, but don't worry, I've got some recommendations for you. Have you tried Adobe Premiere Pro? It's a bit pricey but definitely worth it if you're serious about editing. If you're on a budget, DaVinci Resolve is a great free option. And if you're just starting out, HitFilm Express has a lot of features for a beginner-friendly price (aka free). Also, if you're interested in becoming a video editor yourself, check out these video editor interview questions: -editor-interview-questions/. They're super helpful if you're trying to land a job in the industry. Good luck with your editing!
 
Once I have recorded a video using TEAMS and uploaded it into Streams, is there a way to edit content that is not at the beginning or end (TRIM Content) without deleting all the content prior to or after desired editing area?
 
If you want further editing you'll have to download the video, edit it in some local editor, and the re-upload the video. You could use replace to re-upload and keep it in the same place. -replace-video
