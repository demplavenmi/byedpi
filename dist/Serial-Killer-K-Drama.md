Storytelling requires dramatic stakes. Dramatic stakes need to be high. And what's higher than life and death? Whether it's an alien race contemplating its end or an emergency room doctor trying to save the life of a patient, death provides the ultimate in instant drama. There's no wiggle room. You either are, or you aren't.

The 3-part series, starring Martin Clunes as Det. Chief Inspector Colin Sutton, dramatizes the real life police hunt and eventual capture of a serial killer who terrorized southwest London from 2002 to 2006. In the scene where the perp is eventually captured, a detective searches the house where the perp lives.
 
The last place left to look is the attic. The detective climbs into it without waiting for back-up. He finds the perp, arrests him, and then has to face Det. Chief Inspector Sutton for disobeying orders.
 
Nor is there much focus on the motives or evil character of the serial killer. We find out he is a clamper ( one of those people who puts boots on cars which are illegally parked) and is married with two young children. In one scene where he approaches two young girls at a bus stop, they laugh at him and walk away.

Sutton, on whose memoir this TV series is based, gets grief from Louise, his second wife for missing a family wedding in Spain because of the investigation (he leaves her at the boarding gate.) He also gets grief from his daughter (by his first marriage) for missing his own birthday celebration which the daughter has arranged.
 
For most of the world, the reactions of wife and daughter are understandable. For those of us who have had 24/7 jobs where spouses have understood and tolerated the demands of that kind of profession, we feel resentment against his loved ones for not understanding that his job is so much more important than a family wedding in Spain.
 
Lastly, a stark difference between British and American law enforcement appears in the concluding scenes of Manhunt where Sutton takes responsibility for a screw-up in the investigation that delayed apprehension of the serial killer.
 
He travels to France to tell the parents of the last victim, Amelie Delagrange, that their daughter might still be alive had the screw-up not happened. I doubt whether such a scenario would be possible here given the speed with which such parents would bring a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the police department.

According to the plot development so far, I could believe it if Kang Tae Wook killed Kevin Lee in error. It also added to the complexity of the relationship between Tae Wook and Hye Ran if Tae Wook was the murderer but did not confess to Hye Ran, rather letting her shoulder the murder charge while defending her vehemently. It added a dark side to Tae Wook who had been projecting an honourable image so far.
 
I guess it is just that I kept expecting a twist in the end , so I refused to believe that Tae Wook was the murderer as what the hints had pointed out, and kept waiting to be surprised by what the writer had in store for us.
 
The dumb detective! I mean everything started because he insisted it was a murder based on his gut feeling. Oh well, so his gut feeling was correct in the end, but seriously can he please do his work and find evidence? Instead of randomly zeroing in on suspects and insinuating that they are the killer? And basically making himself a nuisance?
 
It has been few days since i finished watching it and i still cant move on with the ending..just like you, i expected a happy ending for hye ran and tae wook. I thought it would have been bettet if myung woo didnt just showed up at the police station, then tae wook would still be alive..but regardless of the ending i still love it.. I was It was my first time to watch kim nam joo, and she got me here..she is superb in her acting..i would look forward to her new drama..
 
Well, I would say that if not for Kim Nam Joo, the drama would be quite boring. Her series are all a must watched for me. Strongly recommend Queen of Reversal, Queen of Housewives and My Husband has a Family.
 
Acting is superb because it draws out emotions from whoever wacthes it. Go Rye Ran and Tae Wook led the cast in convincing performances. Even the Dumb Detective who gets negative reviews! Its really the script writer who went overboard with that character. The detective, a supposed veteran for 27 years, didnt fit his part.
 
Was FL complicit in her unhappyness? I would say mostly through lack of communication and asking him to believe her lie instead of telling him the truth (something he was also guilty of with his coverup of the manslaughter). But before the last two episodes they patched things up and her current unhappyness is due to bad luck.
 
Frankly, I see here a clear parallel between what he and what she complain about (in his case, it would be his manslaughter, etc., and trying to have his cake and eat it too -wanting to protect her while savaging her reputation (and career, that would have been geopardized by having concrete evidence of the affair) as well as his own (for self explanatory reasons he wanted nothing of the affair and the manslaughter to reach the public, though of curse if he did not manage to save her with what he had, like he ultimately did, he would have always been able to confess to the murder himself, as he was about to do before MW turned himself in)- in her case her telling him nothing happened, rather than she was coerced and threatened, and lied to Kevin in the camera footage).
 
I have spent my entire adult life campaigning to end violence against women and girls, and, as a founder of the feminist law reform group Justice for Women, which primarily deals with the issue of women who kill violent male partners as a response to domestic violence, you would think I have had a gut-full of blood and gore. Add to the mix the fact that I believe I was once followed by the serial killer Peter Sutcliffe only days prior to him murdering his final victim, you would be forgiven for assuming that I hate the serial killer genre.
 
It can also provide us with the opportunity to better understand the devastating effects of such crime, to empathise with the victims, and to face facts that the men that commit such atrocities towards women hate us. Understanding this can galvanise us to action.
 
In the meantime, I am planning on watching the BBC real-life crime drama The Investigation which centres the case of the murdered journalist Kim Wall. The killer, apparently, is not even named. We see how dedicated police officers snared her killer. It will be the perfect antidote for me to balance out the endless work I do investigating unsolved murders and writing about men getting away with rape.
 
Sometimes, a serial killer drama will come along that gives a valuable insight into a profound but hard-to-grasp truth about murderous men. Take The Fall, a drama series based on Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson tracking down serial killer Paul Spector. The Spector character is so very frightening because he is an ordinary family man. The idea that these men are monsters can derail entire police investigations and also lead to their victims being disbelieved.
 
I never wanted to be at the center of a sensational true crime story. Nobody does. But once I was thrust into the public eye, there was no going back. One moment I was living my life as an anonymous student. Without warning, my every action was under a microscope. Even after my acquittal, no part of my life was safe from scrutiny and judgment.
 
As I tried to find some meaning in the senseless murder of my roommate, as I tried to process the trauma of my resulting wrongful conviction, the storytellers descended like vultures, transforming all that tragedy into content. True crime sunk its teeth into my life and it has yet to let go.
 
The world was a lot more violent in the past. Back in medieval England, historians estimate the murder rate was ten times what it is today. It may not seem that way, but that is largely a result of how swamped we are with media about crime. This has been true since the invention of the printing press and the spread of print media. By the 16th century, more official police departments were forming, crimes were being prosecuted, defendants were standing trial, public executions were taking place and early printers were running off broadsheets and pamphlets about all the gory details. The visibility of crime went way up.
 
These posters and pamphlets often focused on familial murders, the murders of children, or romantic and marital murders. And the ethical questions that ricochet through the true crime world today were present even back then. Was it morally proper to focus on the perpetrator instead of the victim?
 
The most prominent answer back then said not only was it proper, but it was necessary. These pamphlets and broadsheets usually had a moralizing message. They were designed to both maintain the social order and protect the souls of the citizenry from being corrupted by the devil. This religious motive was seen as perfectly consistent with the lurid stories and gruesome images being printed, often by clergy.
 
By the 19th century, the profiteering and sensationalism of true crime was out of control. Crime and violence inspired melodramas depicting brutal murders and gave audiences black-and-white narratives with stock villains. There were even marionette shows based on murder plots. The true crime fan of the 19th century might read about a sensational crime in the newspaper, watch a play based on the events, sing a song about the kille
