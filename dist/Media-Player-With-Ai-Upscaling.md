If you are a mature video editor, you likely know how to make your videos more concise. However, for newcomers, detailed instructions are provided in the following parts, covering video quality editing, color editing, and more.
 
Sometimes adjusting the video color range doesn't work properly. In that case, you can try this step for a VLC upscale by adjusting the output settings. All you need to do is to follow a few simple steps given below:
 
The software has two groups of filters named Essential and Video Effects. Brightness, hue, contrast, etc., come under Essential effects, while Video Effects contain more complex settings such as the Colors adjustment tab, Crop settings, etc.
 
A multicore processor can significantly improve the VLC video upscaling capabilities of your computer. It supports multithreaded decoding and has much better speeds than single-thread decoding. VLC uses zero threads by default, so it changes the number of threads according to the situation.

Washed out colors and blurry video playback annoy you a lot? How to maximize video quality in VLC? Is it possible to use VLC settings for best video quality? Stay here for 2 or 3 minutes and this post will share with you the most effective solutions to enhance and upscale 4K/DVD quality during playback in VLC.
 
Load your 4K video (irrespective of true 4K or upscaled 4K video) into VLC but find that VLC becomes choppy or lagging in 4K HEVC video playback. That might be related with the high frame rate. Download **Winxvideo AI** to Free and Safe change 60FPS to 30FPS while keeping 4K video resolution and HEVC codec intact. Afterwards, open this 4K video footage to VLC and it will playback it smoothly without any trouble. This free 4K converter also supports you to upscale and improve video quality via Deinterlacing tech and **High Quality Engine**, which together substantially realize video quality upscaling, not just literally upscaling. More features are awaiting you to try!
 
Have any background knowledge about YUV? If so, you're supposed to know that Y stands for luminance (aka. brightness) and that U and V are chrominance components. In case your video picture is substandard in color components, you're suggested to enable the "Add a YUV4MPEG2 header" to optimize chrominance components and maximize video quality.
 
When it comes to VLC settings for best video quality, filters is a must mention. VLC filters feature cover dozens of filter effects. As for video quality upscaling, here takes the classic "Color threshold" and "Deinterlace" for instance.
 
As you can see from the following picture, it enables you to adjust saturation threshold and similarity threshold values to increase your video quality. Meanwhile, activate "Deinterlacing" feature to fix interlaced image back to normal deinterlaced one. Of course, there are other filter effects available. You can test it if time is ample.
 
If you want to upscale 1080p full HD video to 4K in VLC, forget it please. Even though the resulting file shows the resolution as 4K 2160p, the real resolution doesn't get any substantial improvement. That's called fake 4K video.
 
NVIDIA introduced a cutting-edge technology for video playback called RTX Video Super Resolution. Initially, it was limited to a few select programs like the latest Chrome and Edge versions, but it has now been integrated into the widely used VLC media player.
 
This feature empowers users to elevate their video playback experience by upscaling resolutions, including upscaling VLC from 720p to 1080p, 1080p to 1440p or 4k, and even 1440p to 4k. Currently accessible in the latest beta version of VLC (version 3.0.19), activating this feature requires manual intervention in the NVIDIA Control Panel and is exclusively compatible with NVIDIA RTX series graphics cards utilizing the latest driver (531.14 and above).
 
Step 2. Activate RTX Video Super Resolution through the NVIDIA Control Panel. Open the panel, navigate to "Video," and select "Adjust video image settings." Within this menu, locate the "RTX video enhancement" settings and check the Super resolution option.
 
Step 3. Fine-tune the quality to your liking, with level 4 providing optimal results. Once enabled, enjoy the benefits of higher-resolution video playback on VLC. Notice sharper details and a reduction in image blur, offering a more immersive and satisfying viewing experience.
 
Yes, VLC does support upscaling. It has the capability to upscale video resolutions, allowing users to view content in higher resolutions than the original source. This can enhance the visual quality of videos, especially when played on screens with higher resolutions.
 
Enhance your video playback with VLC's RTX upscaling in three steps. First, download the beta version at -rtx-upscaler/vlc-3.0.19-nvidia-upscaler2.7z. Next, activate RTX Video Super Resolution in the NVIDIA Control Panel, adjusting settings under "Video" and selecting "RTX video enhancement." Optimal results are achieved at level 4. Experience crisper details and reduced blur for a more immersive viewing experience.
 
To activate Video Super Resolution, just open the Nvidia Control Panel and check the Super Resolution option within the Adjust Video Settings section. Note that this feature requires an Nvidia RTX series graphics card and the latest driver (531.14 and above).
 
Yes, VLC (VideoLAN Client) has the capability to change the resolution of a video during playback. You can adjust the video resolution through the Video Effects menu, which provides options for cropping, aspect ratio, and scaling. Keep in mind that this adjustment is temporary and only applies to the current session of playback.

So here's something I've been wondering. I have a few older videos stored away from my attempt at being a Youtube star about 10+ years ago. They were shot in 720p60, and I'd love to see what they'd look like upscaled to 1440p or 4K.
 
GPU upscaling refers to the process of using a graphics processing unit (GPU) to increase the resolution of a video or image. This can be done through various algorithms and techniques, such as super-resolution or neural network-based methods.
 
If you're looking for an application that supports upscaling videos using AMD GPUs, you can consider using a popular video editing software called Adobe Premiere Pro. Adobe Premiere Pro provides GPU-accelerated video processing and supports AMD GPUs for tasks like video upscaling.
 
With Adobe Premiere Pro, you can import your older videos and apply upscaling effects to increase their resolution to 1440p or 4K. The GPU acceleration provided by AMD GPUs can significantly speed up the upscaling process and improve overall performance.
 
It's great that you're looking to upscale your older videos to higher resolutions like 1440p or 4K for a better viewing experience. While VLC Player and Edge have indeed introduced GPU-accelerated upscaling features, there are other specialized video editing applications that might better suit your needs, especially if you're using AMD GPUs.
 
One popular choice for upscaling videos with AMD GPU support is DaVinci Resolve. It offers robust upscaling options and can take advantage of the GPU's power for efficient processing. Alternatively, if you're looking for a more mobile-friendly solution, you can explore mobile video editing apps like CapCut and Kinemaster, both of which have their own upscaling capabilities. However, be aware that mobile apps may have limitations compared to desktop software.
 
Give one of these options a try, and you'll likely achieve the video quality you're aiming for. Remember to check the specific GPU requirements and features in the software to ensure compatibility with your AMD GPU.
 
If you're looking to upscale your older videos using an AMD GPU, you might want to consider using a program like "AMD Radeon Software" or "AMD Adrenalin." These software packages often include features for enhancing vid
