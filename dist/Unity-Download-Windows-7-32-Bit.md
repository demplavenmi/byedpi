When installing Unity on a Windows machine, you are allowed to select "iOS Build Support" as one of the components to install. However, it is not possible to make an iOS build from Windows. Why is this package available on Windows? What does it offer?
 
As you can't make IOS bundles on windows the only thing you can do is to make the process better by not having the requirement of installing Unity on both windows and OSX. You could set up automated tools which take the output from unity and automatically build the game on a mac so that you don't have to go though as many hoops. See Jenkins.

Developing on Windows and building on Mac is the major reason for its existance on Windows!Lots of programmers does not like to code on Mac. And iOS build support on Windows make modifying iOS buildsettings on Windows be possible!
 
I am currently running Ubuntu 13 Desktop edition on a second PC on my desk, which has one small monitor. For work reasons my primary machine must be Windows(7), and it has multiple monitors, of varying resolutions.
 
I wish to have my Ubuntu Desktop fill up all those Windows monitors at their native resolutions so that I can basically make Ubuntu my primary desktop, without physically plugging in the keyboard and monitors into the Ubuntu box. Both machines are connected within a fire walled internal 1Gb network, and both have fixed IP addresses.
 
I have already downloaded and run MobaXterm, and running terminals over SSH seems to work fine. I have also run Firefox and other Ubuntu-machine applications in windows on my Windows machine, by calling them from the SSH terminal command line. But no luck so far getting the full Unity monty across my Windows monitors.
 
Unix machines have been able to run software on a remote machine and display the GUI locally for almost two decades. Linux and Mac OS X support X Forwarding with no extra software. Any terminal on Linux should do X Forwarding, Mac users need to run "Applications > Utilities > XTerm". In a command line terminal run "ssh -Y [email protected] matlab" and you'll be running matlab on "compute.example.edu" but seeing it on your desktop.Windows users need two pieces of software: an secure shell program (ssh) to establish the remote connection and an X Server to handle the local display.Prerequisites

I'm not sure if you tried this already, but you could install Ubuntu within a VM on Windows by using either VirtualBox or VMware. Then you can fire up the virtual machine on one screen, and use Ubuntu there while still being "physically" on Windows.
 
Hi, I also have the same need to have zoom inside of unity.
Can you be more specific on how this can be done.
To say that other devs have done it is great but not so helpful. We need to know how.
 
Hello @jon.zoom Thank you for your reply.
I agree with you that other developers has added Zoom SDK in Unity but many developer like us are not getting any step by step documentations for this.
Can you please provide any step by step documentation as right now when we are trying to use ZOOM SDK from MarketPlace our Unity is crashing. We are unable to get the issue as no exception is there.
Can you please help in this.
 
Unfortunately our lack of a Unity plugin means that we do not have explicit support for Unity at this time. This probably will not always be the case as we continue to expand our SDK offerings, but for the time being we can only support native usage of the SDK.
 
I tried to use demo .net application which is coming with SDK that is working fine. But when I am creating a wrapper over that application and trying to use in Unity my application is getting crash at
 
Hi would you please confirm that the online documentation for the sdk and the c# wrapper is up to date with the latest c# package files? I find instances where it seems the documentation does not match what I downloaded.
 
Unfortunately as mentioned in our documentation, the C# wrapper is provided as a reference and is not actively supported right now. We can only assist with direct usage of the SDK in a native C++ environment.
 
I watched a video once and I believe the correct approach is the import the mesh then attach the texture in the mesh in unity separatly. In the properties of the mesh there is a square thingy where you drag-drop the image.
 
So, after import I need to rotate the mesh, but then the directions of the mesh is bananas (red X should point to the right and blue Z in the opposite direction as well. Plus the fact that the mesh stands vertical (rotated -90 about X on export). **The export seems completely messed up**.
 
To show how easy it is to plug Firebase into your Unity project, we made asample game, MechaHamster. If you want to try out adding Firebase to a game, usethe starter version that's on **GitHub**. If you want a completed version, checkout the versions in the **App Store** or the **Google Play store**.
 
Install Unity 2021 LTS or later. Support for Unity 2020 is considereddeprecated, and will no longer be actively supported after the next majorrelease. Earlier versions may also be compatible but won't be activelysupported.
 
Analytics enabled

- Add the Firebase package for Google Analytics: FirebaseAnalytics.unitypackage
- Add the packages for any other Firebase products you want to use in your app. For example, to use Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database:
 FirebaseAuth.unitypackage and FirebaseDatabase.unitypackage

Add the packages for the Firebase products you want to use in your app.For example, to use Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database:
FirebaseAuth.unitypackage andFirebaseDatabase.unitypackage
 
Add the following using statement and initialization code at the start of yourapplication. You can check for and optionally update Google Play services to theversion that is required by the Firebase Unity SDK before calling any othermethods in the SDK.
 
When you're creating a game, it's often much easier to test your game in theUnity editor and on desktop platforms first, then deploy and test on mobiledevices later in development. To support this workflow, we provide asubset of the Firebase Unity SDKs which can runon Windows, macOS, Linux, and from within the Unity editor.
 
The Firebase Unity SDK includes desktop workflow supportfor a subset of products, enabling certain parts of Firebase to be used in theUnity editor and in standalone desktop builds on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
 
Firebase provides the remaining desktop libraries as stub (non-functional)implementations for convenience when building for Windows, macOS, and Linux.Therefore, you don't need to conditionally compile code to target the desktop.

Executive functions (EFs) are high-level cognitive processes, often associated with the frontal lobes, that control lower level processes in the service of goal-directed behavior. They include abilities such as response inhibition, interference control, working memory updating, and set shifting. EFs show a general pattern of shared but distinct functions, a pattern described as "unity and diversity". We review studies of EF unity and diversity at the behavioral and genetic levels, focusing on studies of normal individual differences and what they reveal about the functional organization of these cognitive abilities. In particular, we review evidence that across multiple ages and populations, commonly studied EFs (a) are robustly correlated but separable when measured with latent variables; (b) are not the same as general intelligence or g; (c) are highly heritable at the latent level and seemingly also highly polygenic; and (d) activate both common and specific neural areas and can be linked to individual differences in neural activation, volume, and connectivity. We highlight how considering individual differences at the behavioral and neural levels can add considerable insight to the investigation of the functional organization of the brain, and conclude with some key points about individual differences to consider when interpreting neuropsychological patterns of dissociation.

**UPDATE 4/27/2021:**We listened to the community and will keep JCenter as a read-only repository indefinitely. Our customers and the community can continue to rely on JCenter as a reliable mirror for Java packages.
 
Bintray has provided the open source community a free, universal cloud platform for publishing and distributing binaries. Bintray helped JFrog support the Java community as the host of the JCenter repository for Java OSS libraries, packages and components. We launched GoCenter and ChartCenter to extend similar services to the Go and cloud-native communities.
 
JFrog is evolving to meet the new challenges that developers face. Many of the services that Bintray provides are now served by the JFrog Platform for the open source community. Similarly, the Go and Helm communities have since created central repo
