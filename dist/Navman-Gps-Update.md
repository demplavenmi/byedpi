Navman was acquired by Brunswick Corporation in June 2004 and became part of Brunswick New Technology. The company struggled to turn a profit, and a mass exodus of senior management staff ensued.[1] The Navman Marine division, which designs and manufactures fish finders, sonar, VHF radios, autopilots, and sailing instruments, was sold by Brunswick to the Norwegian company Navico in April 2007. The Navman PND (Portable Navigation Device) division was sold to MiTAC in the first half of 2007. This business retains principal use of the Navman brand, including the navman.com website. Sales, marketing, and support are primarily based in Gatwick, England. Though market pressures and cutbacks meant, as of 2015, the now Taiwanese-owned company has just two staff in New Zealand, with operations now transferred to an Australian affiliate. Navman Wireless Vehicle Tracking Solutions and Navman Wireless OEM are the remaining Navman divisions. Brunswick sold these two businesses in a single management buy-out transaction in mid-2007. The company is doing business as Navman Wireless.
 
Navman Wireless was a global GPS-based technology and SaaS provider dedicated to developing better ways to capture and apply location, behavior, and diagnostic data from assets and people in real-time to pursue informed, intelligent, and profitable decisions.
 
Navman Wireless OEM Solutions was a division of Navman Wireless Holdings, a privately held company owned by independent investors and Prairie Capital Partners of Chicago. A leading designer and manufacturer of the Jupiter branded GPS modules, Navman Wireless OEM Solutions provides GPS modules, tracking devices and messaging terminals to thousands of companies worldwide for integration into their products and solutions. Its products are also compatible with OEM Data Deliveries Fuel Monitoring and Distribution control systems for heavy equipment.[3] Navman Wireless OEM Solutions was sold to Telit in 2012.

**SmartST v6** used version 1.40 of the low-level MapCore library and introduced a significantly different UI to the previous versions. In particular, in replaced up/down scrollbars with "glide touch" (also called "slide touch") scrolling, similar in concept to the iPhone. This approach, combined with a resistive touch screen, resulted in a number of usability complaints.[4] As well as the UI changes, a number of new features were introduced such as 3D junction views, 3D landmarks, and advanced lane guidance.
 
**SmartST v6.10** was released with the MY-series and used version 1.42 of MapCore. This version restored the option of the traditional up/down buttons in addition to the glide touch used in version 6.
 
**SmartST v7** (with MapCore 1.50) is the latest version of SmartST. The UI has again changed significantly, with a significant simplification of the main menu, and the removal of the "dockable windows" concept. This version also added a number of features over version 6.10:
 
The **S-series** was released in September 2007, with the much-changed SmartST version 6. The flagship S90i model contained a built-in 2-megapixel camera for use with NavPix, something that has not reappeared on later flagship Navman devices.
 
June 2008: **F-Series**. The **F15** [7] is an entry level slim PND sold exclusively through RadioShack stores in the US. Key features of the F15: 3.5" Touch Screen, New UI based on the MioMaps GPS software by MiTAC owned Mio Technology, Maps of US and Puerto Rico, SiRFInstantFixII, and preloaded POIs. A version with a larger 4.3" screen, the **F25** was sold in Europe, with a set of western Europe maps. Support from Navman/MiTAC was largely absent for this device.
 
January 2007: **F-Series**. The F30, F40 and F50 models were added. Based on the existing F20 unit, these new models were bundled with a variety of external modules to add new features out of the box. The F30 included a T1 traffic module to offer traffic (TMC) alerts. The F40 included a B2 module to offer Bluetooth handsfree calling. The F50 included a B2+ module offering both traffic (TMC) and Bluetooth.
 
2006: **F20**. Replacing the iCN 300 series, the F20 is small, fully touch screen and includes the nearest petrol and parking buttons. The F20 was essentially Navman's volume product, selling in great quantities, especially during the Christmas 2006 period.
 
The original top-range units were those of the **600 Series**. These are larger than the 300 and 500 units, offering louder sound and a wider, automotive grade screen. They are not touch screen but are known for being strong and easy to see. The 600 units are the 610, 620, 630, 635 and 650. The 650 came with a built-in 2 GB microdrive and was also OEMed for Delphi and Sony.
 
The TMC Accessory Kit equips the Navman S30 3D with TMC (Traffic Message Channel, this is, traffic alerts & re-routing). The MY TMC is for Navman MY30. S Series Platinum TMC Accessory Kit is compatible with the latest Platinum range S100/150/200 & the Classic S45 and S35.[8]
 
Navman introduced "NavPix" on its iCN 700 portable navigation devices in 2006. Navman was the first company worldwide to introduce NavPix (on which they hold a patent). The NavPix technology combines a digital image with geographical data to create the NavPix image, which is a record of the exact location where that image was taken. The iCN 720 and iCN 750 were the first Navman GPS products that were NavPix-enabled, using a 1.3 MegaPixel camera to take the NavPix.
 
The NavPix image contains the latitude and longitude information within the Exif metadata. These images can be selected on the compatible Navman as an alternative way to define a destination or waypoint when planning a route.
 
The latest Navman sat nav, the S90i offers a 2.0 MegaPixel camera for taking NavPix. Other S-Series models, the S50 and S70, are NavPix compatible meaning NavPix images can be loaded onto the device for use.
 
Navman's Marine Division was acquired by Navico, the world's largest marine electronics company, and is the parent company to leading marine electronics brands: Lowrance, Simrad and B&G. Navico has approximately 1,500 employees globally and distribution in more than 100 countries worldwide. The original core technology and product research and development centre that was Navman remains today intact in the Auckland, New Zealand operation. This is where a number of next generation product platforms are developed and launched for use across the B&G, Lowrance, and Simrad brands.

**Question:**Am looking for a mount for my sat nav but am unsure of the model number. The label on it reads navman F 460. Would be grateful if you could advise me if you have any parts available for it?
