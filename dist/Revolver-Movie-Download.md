**Please Note**: Pistol/Revolver licenses issued by the State of New Hampshire to out-of-state residents are **only** valid within the State of New Hampshire or within a state that recognizes a New Hampshire non-resident pistol/revolver license.
 
It is extremely important that all license holders be aware of the laws and requirements of all reciprocating states when visiting/traveling. Possession of a license does not supersede any other state's laws or license requirements. License holders are subject to the laws of the state they are visiting.
 
If you are a New Hampshire Pistol/Revolver License holder traveling to another state and wish to carry a concealed weapon using your New Hampshire license, contact that state directly to confirm their recognition status before carrying concealed weapons there. For example, some states only recognize a license if the person is 21 years of age or older.

When I first wrote this feature, I was convinced that all firearms historians would immediately agree with me that the Japanese Type 26, for reasons which will be outlined anon, was probably the worst military revolver ever issued. Still, to give the gun a chance and to test my theory, I selected an octet of noted experts whom I have relied on over the years, asking each one to come up with his own candidate for the nadir in revolverdom, being careful not to telegraph the direction in which I was leaning. The results, like the panel, were mixed and not a little surprising.

Though looking good so far, at this point things began to go a bit south. The revolver was double-action only (DAO), a relatively pleasant DA, but DA-only, nonetheless. Accordingly, the hammer had no need of a spur, opting instead for a substantial, rather unattractive, rounded, rectangular-shaped upper portion, which was provided ostensibly to eliminate snagging on clothing and equipment.
 
Our evaluation revolver was an excellent-condition and early-example with a pristine bore. The DA pull was smooth and relatively light at 12 pounds. An important caveat: When the trigger is relaxed, the hammer rebounds to allow the firing pin a bit of breathing space, keeping it away from the rear of the cylinder. It did not provide for a complete automatic safety, as I was able to easily push the hammer most the way forward with my finger off the trigger. If the gun were to be dropped or the hammer otherwise hit, this could be problematic, especially if a round had a high primer.
 
Our shooting evaluation was essayed offhand at 10 yards. The revolver and ammo functioned flawlessly, and six-shot groups were not all that bad, coming in at an average of 5 inches with our best running 3 inches. If reasonable care was taken, the cylinder fired rounds successively with no glitches.
 
Blending the speed and simplicity of a red-dot optic with the reliability and small footprint of iron sights, the new FastDot H3 from HIVIZ might be the best all-purpose handgun sighting system designed to date.
 
Eric Poole meets up with Adam Wainio, founder and president of Ballistic Advantage. His company is a premier barrel maker and provides top-quality pipes to both major gun manufacturers and small-shop gunsmiths. Ballistic Advantage has been a pioneer for profiled barrel blanks and experimenting with a barrel's mass and contours to wring out the best performance. Looking forward, Ballistic Advantage is working on its take on weight-saving carbon fiber barrels and is keeping ahead of new chamberings with interesting offerings like the 8.6 Blackout.
 
If Winchester is known for one thing in firearms, it's lever guns. Both the historic examples and modern renditions are held in high regard, and the centerfire models can command a premium price due to desirability. New for 2024, Winchester is lowering the barrier to entry and raising the fun factor with the return of the Ranger. Now, though, the iconic lever action is chambered for .22 Long Rifle. What's more fun than a rimfire rifle? Probably nothing, that's why Winchester has invested in the recent Wildcat semiauto, Xpert bolt action, and now the Range, all in .22. Eric Poole and Winchester's Rafe Neilson discuss the latest lever addition.
 
Aero Precision is a go-to source for rifle-building components including receivers, handguards, and all the necessaries. New this year is the M4E1 Pro kit, which offers ambidextrous controls: bolt catch/release, radial selector, and even the magazine release. Besides being lefty friendly, the M4E1 Pro also sports the new overbuilt Mod4 handguard designed specifically for professional users and shooters that are just plain hard on their gear. Stepping away from rifle parts, the company is also expanding its suppressor offerings with the new Tephra-22 rimfire can. Finally, the company is teasing the most talked about firearm at SHOT Show 2024: The Aero Precision Lever Action. Kirk Foreman of Aero Precision joins Eric Poole to talk shop from the show floor.
 
SAKO's new 90-series bolt-action rifles have finally hit the U.S. market. Guns & Ammo's Joe Kurtenbach was one of the first American sportsmen to take these guns afield. In pursuit of Colorado elk and mule deer, Kurtenbach takes a break from climbing mountains to describe the SAKO 90 Quest, a lightweight hunter that benefits from modern construction and precision-inspired features.
 
Warne Scope Mounts has unveiled several new red-dot sight riser mounts at the 2024 SHOT Show. One of the challenges of mounting a red dot to a long gun is getting the optimal height setting. These mounts feature included spacers to adjust the height setting to fit individual preference. Warne has also introduced a universal rib mount to easily attach red dots to shotgun ribs. Many turkey shotguns don't have a Pic rail, so this mount gives you access to the entire rib on a shotgun to mount a red dot. If you've never turkey hunted with a red-dot sight, it's a game changer!
 
Warne Scope Mounts has upgraded its popular line of Skyline bipods to the new Skyline lite, with three different options for ARCA, Pic rail and QD pic rail mounting options. The Skyline Lite bipods feature 13 micro adjustments to fine-tune rifle height, 0-, 45-, and 90-degree leg positions, and the universal-style head accepts multiple mounting configurations. Built from premium aluminum and steel, the Skyline Lite bipods have all the modern features we expect while keeping weight low.
 
Smith & Wesson's John Myles has been a regular on the New Product Premier, and he joins Joe Kurtenbach to run it back again at SHOT Show 2024. Last year the company introduced the Response pistol caliber carbine (PCC), an AR-styled platform designed to run off commonly available semiautomatic pistol magazines. A direct-blowback action powers the Response, but what sets the gun apart is its interchangeable magazine well. Mag wells are easy to swap for owners, and the Response comes with both an M&P mag option, as well as a mag well for Glock-pattern 9mm magazines. New for 2024 is a magazine well for SIG Sauer P320 mags. No matter what pistol platform you choose to shoot, Smith & Wesson wants you to rely on the Response for your PCC needs.
 
John Snodgrass from Leupold joins Joe Kurtenbach to discuss the latest edition to the company's tactical line of magnified optics: The Mark 4HD riflescope family. The new series utilizes a 4X zoom ratio across five magnification ranges: 1-4.5X, 2.5-10X, 4.5-18X, 6-24X, and 8-32X. Each magnification will include multiple scope variants offering first- or second-focal-plane reticles, as well as different reticle designs and illumination options. Like the Mark 5HD series, there is a Mark 4HD riflescope for nearly any ballistic pursuit, all build to Leupold's rigorous standard for reliability, durability, and optical performance.
 
Live from the show floor, Joe Kurtenbach visits Grant Dubuc at the Smith & Wesson booth to talk lever guns. The new Model 1854 in .44 Rem. Mag. was an absolute stunner at SHOT Show 2024, and Guns & Ammo was on hand to get all the details. Drawing inspiration from Horace Smith and Dan Wesson's Volcanic lever-action firearms, the Model 1854 combines classic lines with modern materials and design. To maximize utility, the gun's polymer furniture and stainless finish offer all-weather durability while the optics rail and flat-faced trigger account for modern tastes. The new platform from Smith & Wesson is going to fun to watch this year!
