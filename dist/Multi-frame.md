Walking is different. You would need to have multiple shapes/sprites that make up the figure and use the rotate, x and y coordinates to move the shapes and give the illusion of it walking. It can be time consuming to get all the coordinates and rotations just right.

The frames panel is in the animations tab. Here is documentation on adding multi-frame animation. FYI - if you are looking at one of the earlier GameLab activities within the earlier lessons, you may not have the frame by frame animation option. I do know it is available in a new GameLab project and in the later lessons.
 
The length of the pixel data bit stream encapsulated in Pixel Data (7FE0,0010), in bytes, when all the fragments have been combined, not including any trailing padding to even length in the last Fragment added for encapsulation.
 
A Multi-frame Image is defined as a Image whose pixel data consists of a sequential set of individual Image Pixel frames. A Multi-frame Image is transmitted as a single contiguous stream of pixels. Frame headers do not exist within the data stream.
 
Each individual frame shall be defined (and thus can be identified) by the Attributes in the Image Pixel Module (see Section C.7.6.3). All Image IE Attributes shall be related to the first frame in the Multi-frame image.

The frames within a Multi-frame Image shall be conveyed as a logical sequence. The information that determines the sequential order of the frames shall be identified by the Data Element Tag or Tags conveyed by the Frame Increment Pointer (0028,0009). Each specific Image IOD that supports the Multi-frame Module specializes the Frame Increment Pointer (0028,0009) to identify the Attributes that may be used as sequences.
 
Even if only a single frame is present, Frame Increment Pointer (0028,0009) is still required to be present and have at least one value, each of which shall point to an Attribute that is also present in the Data Set and has a value.
 
For example, in single-frame Instance of an IOD that is required to or may contain the Cine Module, it may be appropriate for Frame Time (0018,1063) to be present with a value of 0, and be the only target of Frame Increment Pointer (0028,0009).
 
When the IOD permits the use of Multi-frame Functional Groups as a Standard or Standard Extended SOP Class, Frame Increment Pointer may contain the single value of Per-Frame Functional Groups Sequence (5200,9230) to indicate that the Functional Groups contain the descriptors of the frames.
 
For example, the Multi-frame Grayscale Word Secondary Capture Image IOD requires the Multi-frame Module but also permits the Multi-frame Functional Groups, for example, to describe the plane position of each frame.
 
When Stereoscopic Pairs are present, and the pixel data is uncompressed, or compressed with a Transfer Syntax that does not explicitly convey the semantics of stereo pairs, the first and subsequent odd frames (frames numbered from 1) are the left frame of each pair, and the second and subsequent even frames are the right frame of each pair.
 
If the pixel data is compressed with a Transfer Syntax that does explicitly convey the semantics of stereo pairs, then the identification of the left and right frames in the compressed pixel data will be as defined in the compressed bit stream.
 
The presence of Stereo Pairs Present (0022,0028) is independent of the use of Instances of the Stereometric Relationship IOD. In particular, no further description of the method of acquisition of the stereoscopic pairs is required, such as might be present in Attributes of the Stereo Pairs Sequence (0022,0020) of the Stereometric Relationship IOD. The definition of the references to left and right pairs in that IOD prohibit the encoding of the left and right pairs in the same Instance, as distinct for the usage here.
 
Not all multi-frame IODs are sufficiently generic in their description to permit the presence of stereoscopic pairs. E.g., the Video Endoscopic Image IOD, Video Microscopic IOD and Video Photographic IODs are, since they do not specify any conflicting constraints on the meaning of the frames.
 
Normally segmentations are saved to DICOM as segmentation objects or RT structure sets (and can be loaded if you install Reporting and SlicerRT extensions). Is there an option to save into these standard formats?
 
@Sandor\_Konya what happens after you try to load the series, despite the warnings? Do you have a CT series corresponding to that labeled volume dataset? That way you could confirm that Slicer accurately interpreted image geometry.
 
You could also consider using plastimatch convert or dcm2niix to convert that DICOM series into NRRD or NIfTI format, and then load those into Slicer. I believe those tools are more robust than Slicer in interpreting DICOM multiframe objects (with the exception of DICOM segmentation object, but it is unlikely that is the object you have).
 
If i load them despite warnings i get following (the load warnig is overlayed on the advaned mode tab)
Capture1507249 68.7 KB
and only get 2 of them loaded in the data tree (theones that are displayed w/o warning in the background)
 
I suppose that the files in the folder should contain information about the transformation of the datasets ( CT series and a SPECT matched with ridig body transformation) and the segmentation results to.
 
It is also possible that frames are missing or the acquisition has variable number of frames. If you use a recent night build, then the MultiVolume importer writes thr reasons why it rejects loading of the data set into the Slicer application log. It would be useful if you could copy the log messages here. You can find the logs in menu: Help / Report a bug.
 
Could you upload the complete log (only remove patient information from the log - patient name, ID, etc)? If it is too large then you can upload to pastebin.com, dropbox, onedrive, or gdrive and post the link.
 
Regarding integration of dcm2niix, it would make sense to first consider this not in the context of multivolume, but for parsing scalar volumes. Multivolume plugin does not parse or load scalar volumes by itself, it delegates that task to the scalar volume plugin. To make an educated decision of whether it makes sense to consider integrating dcm2niix into Slicer, I would want to see some meaningful comparison of different tools to demonstrate its superiority to alternatives. I do not have resources to work on such at the moment.
 
Thanks for the explanation, I have been following multiple discussions and it seems I missed the point that these are just simple 3D volumes in multi-frame format and you are right that for this it is not necessary to use MultiVolume infrastructure
 
This is definitely something that can debugged - by default the DICOMScalarVolumePlugin should be using the same code path as the Add Dialog, with the ability to force the use of other readers, as described in the thread linked below.
 
@lassoan under what circumstances did you get that error? I just loaded the 3D.dcm file through the dicom module on a linux system with a nightly build from August 4th. I had no problems no matter what reader approach (GDCM or DCMTK or Archetype all match the Add Data result).
 
It is an interesting twist in the story. DICOM reading fails because 3 of the 4 series has the same series instance uid, therefore the DICOM reader tries to read them as one series, but in fact they are completely independent volumes.
 
For me it seems to be a violation of he DICOM standard that multiple volumes have the same series instance UID, but it is interesting that both this data set and most likely the Mirada Simplicity generated data set suffers from the same issue.
 
@Sandor\_Konya did you do anything with those files prior to loading into Slicer? Did you apply any anonymization on Mirada or using any other tools, or you are confident those files are exactly as they were created by Mirada?
 
This information model is a simplification of the real world concepts and activities of medical imaging; for acquisition modalities, a Study is approximately equivalent to an ordered procedure, and a Series is approximately equivalent to a performed data acquisition protocol element. In other domains, such as Radiotherapy, the Study and Series are less clearly related to real world entities or activities, but are still required for consistency.
 
I have encountered a bit of an odd scenario when using overlays on a multi-time-frame image. It seems that the behaviour of the overlay depends on the number of z-slices in the image. I am working with a multi-channel, multi-slice, multi-frame hyperstack (4, 3, 15 to be precise):
 
If I try the same scenario on a hyperstack with just 1 z-slice, even on a 1-slice duplicate of the image I used before, the overlay is only visible on the first time frame.
Using just 1 channel instead of 1 z-slice will keep the overlay on every time frame.
 
I'm trying get all images in a multi-frame DICOM file. Right now I was successfully able to see and save a single image in a single-frame DICOM file, by using the pydicom and matplotlib libraries, like so:
 
I've searched a bit on the web, but couldn't seem to find anything to enlighten me. I wanted to know if someone has passed through this, and what's the best way to overcome it, and be able to get all images in a multi-frame DICOM file.
 
DICOM is essentially a 'three-dimensional' image format: it can store lots of images or 'slices'. However, since colour images are already 3-dimensional (height, width, RGB channels), DICOM datasets can actually be 4-dimensional (apparently... I didn't know this). At least, I think that's why there are four elements in the shape of your dataset.
 
I am using the IMAQ function "Write File 2." Is there anyway to use
