
 
A viable system is a utility that functions as a long-term, self-sufficient business enterprise, establishes organizational excellence, and provides appropriate levels of infrastructure maintenance, operation, and reinvestment that allow the utility to provide reliable water services now and in the future.
 
The Master Plan presents the state's roadmap for viable water and wastewater utilities that safeguard public health, protect the environment, support vibrant communities and encourage economic development.

The State Water Infrastructure Authority and the Local Government Commission have developed criteria to determine how local government units should be assessed for need and eligibility under the Viable Utility Reserve. Identified distressed units must:
 
The criteria were used to evaluate 496 local government units with water and/or sewer systems. This determination is an important first step in a closer evaluation of the utility's status. In addition, it is a factor in the allocation of $9 million in funding made available through Viable Utility Reserve legislation, Session Law 2020-79, signed into law by Governor Roy Cooper in July 2020.
 
3. A unit with a Total Assessment Criteria Score that: a) Equals or exceeds 9 for units providing both drinking water and wastewater services, or b) Equals or exceeds 8 for units providing only one service, either drinking water or wastewater, or
 
Session Law 2020-79 required the State Water Infrastructure Authority and Local Government Commission to develop criteria to assess and review local government units, and to utilize the assessment and review process to identify distressed units.
 
Even if enough funds were available to address all of today's capital needs, funding by itself does not safeguard long-term viability. Comprehensive management of a water utility's infrastructure, organization, and finances is needed.

Utilities are simple HTML classes typically scoped to a single CSS property, like border-style or background-color. Utilities can be used additively to style an object from scratch or to override a style defined in component CSS. Utilities allow designers and developers to build and test new designs and components without abstracting their work into traditional semantic names or altering production CSS.
 
Most USWDS utilities are built to assign a single CSS property a single value. Our utilities are named .[base]-[value], where [base] is often the name of the CSS property the utility targets and the parts of the utility name are separated by a hyphen. For example, margin-top-2. Our utility classes are designed to make sense at a glance to anyone familiar with standard CSS properties.
 
Each utility module referenced in the settings section, above, can accept one of the utility module names outlined in the following table. The more utilities your project uses, the larger the utilities CSS will be.
 
The size of each module will change based on its module settings. For instance, if a module is set to output responsive classes and state variants, it will be much larger than if it includes only the base classes and no variants.
 
The Entrez Programming Utilities (E-utilities) are a set of eight server-side programs that provide a stable interface into the Entrez query and database system at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The E-utilities use a fixed URL syntax that translates a standard set of input parameters into the values necessary for various NCBI software components to search for and retrieve the requested data. The E-utilities are therefore the structured interface to the Entrez system, which currently includes 38 databases covering a variety of biomedical data, including nucleotide and protein sequences, gene records, three-dimensional molecular structures, and the biomedical literature.
 
Residential utility services provided by the city include water, reclaimed water, trash and recycling collection, wastewater, and stormwater. Residents can manage their utilities account online or by calling 727-893-7341.
 
Residents that are having trouble paying their utility bill can call the Utility Customer Service Call Center at 727-893-7341 to make payment arrangements.

Customers are encouraged to make payment arrangements with the City as soon as possible to avoid the associated fees.
 
With the Renter Utility Relief Program, eligible renters may apply for assistance for past due electric, sanitation, and water bills from the City of St. Petersburg and Duke Energy. Find more information at stpete.org/utilityrelief.
 
Additional information about resident utilities billing and management can be found in the Utility Billing FAQs document referenced at the top of this page. Information regarding how water meters are read, billing disputes, returned checks, delinquent accounts, and termination of service are included below.
 
All customers within the City of St. Petersburg have their water use measured by a meter. Charges for the amount of water consumed are based on the consumption registered during a billing period. Meter readings may be estimated due to overgrown vegetation, unrestrained animals, locked gates, standing water, or other hazards.
 
All City of St. Petersburg meters measure water in hundreds of gallons. To read a meter, disregard the red hand, the zero printed on the face (far right), and the first movable register on the right side of the meter. Read all other registers as they appear. This gives customers the reading as it would appear on their bill. To obtain their consumption, customers must subtract the prior month's reading from the current reading and add two zeros to the remainder.
 
Customers who have a dispute regarding their bill and are unable to resolve it by speaking with the Utility Billing staff may petition the Utility Billing Review Committee (UBRC). More information and the application can be found on the Utility Billing Review Committee webpage.
 
It is the policy of the City of St. Petersburg to present checks twice before notifying the customer. Checks returned by the bank two times, for any reason, are charged back to the service account and are subject to service charges as indicated below:
 
An account becomes delinquent when it is not paid by the due date shown on the bill. Most utility customers pay their utility bills on time each month, but the small portion of customers that don't end up costing everyone more. In an effort to encourage prompt payment from all customers, a late charge of $5.00, or 1.5% of the unpaid balance, whichever is greater, will be charged to the utility account. Failure to pay after the late notice will result in a shut-off notice being delivered to the service address. An $8.00 charge is applied against the account when a final notice tag is left at the property. Termination Notices will be mailed to the property. Failure to pay on the specified date will result in termination of service.
 
The Billing & Collections Department will not restore utility services after hours to customers who have been locked off for non-payment, unless they pay their full delinquent balance using the Interactive Voice Response System (IVR) or Click2Gov (on-line) payment options. The after-hours shift is from the hours of 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.
 
The City of St. Petersburg does not wish to discontinue anyone's utility services, but by law, service may be terminated if payment is not made by the date specified on the termination notice if no payment arrangements have been made.
 
Leak adjustments are credits to a utility bill given to qualifying customers who have experienced an involuntary use of water due to a leak. Voluntary uses of water such as lawn watering will not provide the basis for an adjustment.
 
Documentation must include the date of pool fill, or refill if repaired, the estimated number of gallons filled or refilled along with the service address where the pool was installed or repaired. Swimming pools must be properly permitted pursuant to law. Pool fill adjustments are limited to one per calendar year.
 
**Note**: It is recommended that customers continue to pay their utility bills while waiting for their requests to be reviewed. Customers unable to pay the full balance are encouraged to contact the Customer Call Center at 727-893-7341 for assistance.
 
St. Petersburg City Code Section 27-6 requires supporting documentation including, but not limited to, invoices for repair or installation from a plumber or contractor, and/or receipts showing proof of purchase or repair to be submitted with leak adjustment requests.
