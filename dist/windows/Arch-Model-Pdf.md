The ARCH model is appropriate when the error variance in a time series follows an autoregressive (AR) model; if an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is assumed for the error variance, the model is a **generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity** (**GARCH**) model.[2]

ARCH models are commonly employed in modeling financial time series that exhibit time-varying volatility and volatility clustering, i.e. periods of swings interspersed with periods of relative calm. ARCH-type models are sometimes considered to be in the family of stochastic volatility models, although this is strictly incorrect since at time *t* the volatility is completely predetermined (deterministic) given previous values.[3]
 
An ARCH(*q*) model can be estimated using ordinary least squares. A method for testing whether the residuals ϵ t \displaystyle \epsilon \_t exhibit time-varying heteroskedasticity using the Lagrange multiplier test was proposed by Engle (1982). This procedure is as follows:
 
Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is an alternative model in a separate class of exponential smoothing models. As an alternative to GARCH modelling it has some attractive properties such as a greater weight upon more recent observations, but also drawbacks such as an arbitrary decay factor that introduces subjectivity into the estimation.
 
Integrated Generalized Autoregressive Conditional heteroskedasticity (IGARCH) is a restricted version of the GARCH model, where the persistent parameters sum up to one, and imports a unit root in the GARCH process.[9] The condition for this is
 
Hentschel's **fGARCH** model,[12] also known as **Family GARCH**, is an omnibus model that nests a variety of other popular symmetric and asymmetric GARCH models including APARCH, GJR, AVGARCH, NGARCH, etc.

In a different vein, the machine learning community has proposed the use of Gaussian process regression models to obtain a GARCH scheme.[16] This results in a nonparametric modelling scheme, which allows for: (i) advanced robustness to overfitting, since the model marginalises over its parameters to perform inference, under a Bayesian inference rationale; and (ii) capturing highly-nonlinear dependencies without increasing model complexity.[*citation needed*]
 
An ARCH (autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic) model is a model for the variance of a time series. ARCH models are used to describe a changing, possibly volatile variance. Although an ARCH model could possibly be used to describe a gradually increasing variance over time, most often it is used in situations in which there may be short periods of increased variation. (Gradually increasing variance connected to a gradually increasing mean level might be better handled by transforming the variable.)
 
A GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic) model uses values of the past squared observations and past variances to model the variance at time \(t\). As an example, a GARCH(1,1) is
 
We're an MEP firm and typically load one or more architectural files into our projects as Revit Links. We're using Revit 2016 and 2017, our projects have worksharing enabled (not C4R), and all files reside on a local file server, mapped to the same drive letter for everyone.
 
When we receive an updated model from the architect we simply overwrite the old file on the server with the new one, leaving the filename the same. Back in Revit a user with the project already open can go to Manage Links > Reload, (or right click reload from project browser) and they see the updated model. Loading a new arch model will often invoke warnings or errors upon first load; changed/deleted spaces, old room tags needing to move, areas no longer defining a plane, etc. I resolve these warnings and then Sync /w Central and relinquish.
 
It seems that if multiple users have the project open during this process we sometimes run into permissions issues or circular editing requests, where Revit keeps asking users to Sync, going back and forth between users. Especially new users in the process of opening their local file. It's difficult to characterize these issues exactly so I'm wondering if there's a recommended procedure for reliably carrying out updates to linked models with minimal disruption to users workflow.
 
Should all existing users be instructed to use the reload-link command?
Should existing users exit the project before an update?
Should users create a new local immediately following an update?
 
Only if that link is not workshared like in the case of updating an architectural background from a consultant. Almost every project that I've worked on has had multiple live links with people working on all of them simultaneously. We even had one architect that insisted we follow them around the building as they made changes throughout the day. We didn't even consider it.
 
Also try to always pin your linked model so users will not accidentally select it. I do double locking of linked models by using the design option and assign the it to the new & custom option, but don't forget to always make the "Main Model" as your default option. You can create this from the bottom of your screen, see second image for your reference.
 
Flag indicating whether to automatically rescale data if the scaleof the data is likely to produce convergence issues when estimatingmodel parameters. If False, the model is estimated on the data withouttransformation. If True, than y is rescaled and the new scale isreported in the estimation results.
 
Currently, we are working in a HVAC design in a worksharing environment. The Arch model that was provided by the Architectural firm has rooms placed in every floor plant, however, when we link the arch model into the MEP model such instances (rooms) are not transfered or Im not able to identify them.
 
When linking in other models you will have to create spaces that match the architectural model. Under the Analyze tab you will see a button to create a space. After placing all your spaces be sure to run the Space Naming button to get all the names and numbers to match the architectural model.
 
Maybe I wasn't clear. You cannot transfer rooms like you are asking. Creating spaces is the only way to transfer this information between the two models. It only takes a few seconds and there is a option to place all spaces automatically. Give it a try
 
It sounds like the rooms tags are present in the arch revit model yes? If so then you have a visibility issue with your arch revit link. If you bring up your visibility/graphic overrides are you able to turn on room tags in your revit link? See screen-shot below.
 
also remember to see rooms and add their room tags from arch model to your MEP model the Arch model must not be ticked underlay and their visiblity graphics must show rooms and room tags, after you have place tag all rooms from linked model, you can then tick underlay mode for arch model and hide their tags.

Purpose:  The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate and compare the trueness and precision of an intraoral video scanner, an intraoral still image scanner, and a blue-light scanner for the production of digital impressions.
 
Material and methods:  Reference scan data were obtained by scanning a complete-arch model. An identical model was scanned 8 times using an intraoral video scanner (CEREC Omnicam; Sirona) and an intraoral still image scanner (CEREC Bluecam; Sirona), and stone casts made from conventional impressions of the same model were scanned 8 times with a blue-light scanner as a control (Identica Blue; Medit). Accuracy consists of trueness (the extent to which the scan data differ from the reference scan) and precision (the similarity of the data from multiple scans). To evaluate precision, 8 scans were superimposed using 3-dimensional analysis software; the reference scan data were then superimposed to determine the trueness. Differences were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey HSD tests (α=.05).
 
Results:  Trueness in the video scanner group was not significantly different from that in the control group. However, the video scanner group showed significantly lower values than those of the still image scanner group for all variables (P
 
Conclusions:  Digital impressions obtained by the intraoral video scanner showed better accuracy for long-span areas than those captured by the still image scanner. However, the video scanner was less accurate than the laboratory scanner.
 
I remember learning the Breusch-Pagan (nR^2) to test conditional heteroskedasticity, is ARCH another alternative? Also one question i did said to use Generlized Least Square to correct ARCH. Can someone please explain this?
 
Linear regression: Issue: Conditional H, which means variance of residuals is nonconstant and and related to independent variables Detect Conditional H: BP test Correct Condition H: Robus standard errors Time series regression: Issue: ARCH, which means variance of residuals in one period are dependent on variance of residuals in previous period. Detect ARCH: test if coefficient a1 is stat sig different from zero Correct ARCH: generalized least squares Although not completely correct, you can think of ARCH as simply Condition H for a time series m
