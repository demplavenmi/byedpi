A little more than a week ago, I wrote a review of an art show by the artist and TikTok sensation Devon Rodriguez, best known for live drawing subway riders. He is, by some measures, the most famous artist in the world, with many millions of social media followers. He did not like the review.
 
This is a very weird feature of the cultural present. Instead of art that gains traction over time via traditional channels and then breaks out to a wider audience, there are now regularly art phenomena that get explosively popular with an immense audience, leaving art institutions and everyone else to sort out what a particular cultural trend means after it has already happened.

Click on the dropdown in the top left corner of the editor, then select Order Online or Shop All. Click on **Item List**, then click **Arrange and Add Items**. You can toggle on/off the option to display **Most Popular** and **Recent Order**
 
I've gone ahead and merged your post into an existing thread of Sellers who were also looking for information regarding removing the Most Popular items section. Take a look at this Best Answer from this same thread for more details.
 
Where is this Page: Home select Shop All? This must have moved because I'm looking to remove the most popular section on my website and these directions don't match what I see on my dashboard. Also, when I preview my site, this section isn't there, it only shows up when I view my published site.

I took a look at your website, but it seems you may have already figured this out because I don't see the "most popular" section. If you haven't already, you can follow the steps @BernadetteA provided here.
 
I am having the same issue. There is no longer a module for "Order Online page, click "Item List" in the left hand menu. Click the "Arrange & Add Items" button". Please provide updated directions. Thank you.
 
I would like to make the "Most Popular" pages report from my space analytics viewable directly on my space overview page. Users can use this to identify what pages are the most used/most visited. 

Is it not possible to do this natively in confluence? I'm not a Confluence Admin so likely wouldn't be able to use any add-ons.
 
@Srinatha T I'm familiar with both of those articles --> I know how to view those within the "analytics" dashboard.

What I would like to be able to do is insert data from the "analytics" sections directly on a confluence page (i.e. to auto-populate the "Most viewed pages" section on my spaces overview page).
 
Thanks for the reply. I of course slightly mind paying for a feature we used to have, but honestly the pricing seems reasonable and has more functionality that what I had with on-premise.

I will say that I searched for "popular content" in the app store first and your app didn't appear in the list. So possibly some adjustments to keywording for your app in the Marketplace.
 
Thank you @Greg LaViolette for your hint regarding the Marketplace search. Unfortunately, the Marketplace is quite limited in the amount of text that can be indexed and found in the search. We, therefore, have to make compromises.
But we will certainly see if we can optimize things on our side.

This month, high-performance language Rust jumped from position #17 to position #13 in the TIOBE index. This is an all time high for Rust. Gaining 4 positions might seem a small change, but Rust has been "the talk of the town" the last couple of years without making much progress in the TIOBE index. Rust is finally moving up. After the tailwind of the US government, which recently announced to recommend moving from C/C++ to Rust for security reasons, things are going fast for Rust. The community is growing, including the number of third party libraries and tools. In short, Rust is preparing itself for a top 10 position in the TIOBE index. --*Paul Jansen CEO TIOBE Software*
 
The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sitesGoogle, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings.It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the *best* programming language or the languagein which *most lines of code* have been written.
 
The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.
 
The complete top 50 of programming languages is listed below. This overview is published unofficially, because it could be the case that we missed a language. Ifyou have the impression there is a programming language lacking, please notify us at tpci@tiobe.com. Please also check the overview of all programming languages that we monitor.
 
We spent a lot of effort to obtain all the data and keep the TIOBE index up to date. In order to compensate a bit for this, we ask a fee of 5,000 US$ for the complete data set. The data set runs from June 2001 till today. It started with 25 languages back in 2001, and now measures more than 150 languages once a month. The data are available in comma separated format. Please contact sales@tiobe.com for more information.

 #9 Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1 (2024)   
 48% #9 Adjusted Score: 57392% Critics Consensus: Kevin Costner doesn't lack for ambition as he sketches this frontier saga across the widest of canvases, but Horizon's first chapter proves too diffuse in scope for it to satisfy as a self-contained endeavor.
