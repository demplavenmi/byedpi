The reform of the pharmaceuticals framework also aims to address systemic shortages and ensure security of supply of critical medicinal products, at all times. It was informed by a Structured Dialogue with relevant stakeholders on the security of supply of medicines (launched in June 2021). A study on shortages of medicines (published in June 2021) analysed the root causes of shortages of medicines and analysed the current framework in that respect. It presented a series of 16 policy measures at EU and national level, which were considered in the reform of the pharmaceutical framework.

Transporting and handling pharmaceuticals presents both challenges and opportunities for all participants in the cold chain. The pharmaceutical industry relies on air transport for its speed, consistency and efficiency in ensuring high-value, time-sensitive, temperature-controlled products reach their destination safe and sound. However, aviation stakeholders sometimes struggle to provide the high-quality services pharmaceutical shippers expect, including expertise, adequate infrastructure, well-equipped facilities, and the ability to stay on top of regulations.

The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a nationwide settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that would have shielded members of the Sackler family who own the company from civil lawsuits but also would have provided billions of dollars to combat the opioid epidemic.

After deliberating more than six months, the justices in a 5-4 vote blocked an agreement hammered out with state and local governments and victims. The Sacklers would have contributed up to $6 billion and given up ownership of the company but retained billions more. The agreement provided that the company would emerge from bankruptcy as a different entity, with its profits used for treatment and prevention.
 
The older Bisch, who lives in New Jersey, has been speaking out against Purdue and Sackler family members ever since and is part of a relatively small but vocal group of victims and family members who opposed the settlement.
 
Arguments in early December lasted nearly two hours in a packed courtroom as the justices seemed, by turns, unwilling to disrupt a carefully negotiated settlement and reluctant to reward the Sacklers.
 
The issue for the justices was whether the legal shield that bankruptcy provides can be extended to people such as the Sacklers, who have not declared bankruptcy themselves. Lower courts had issued conflicting decisions over that issue, which also has implications for other major product liability lawsuits settled through the bankruptcy system.
 
The U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department, argued that the bankruptcy law does not permit protecting the Sackler family from being sued. During the Trump administration, the government supported the settlement.
 
Jason Amala, a lawyer representing more than 1,000 men who allege they were sexually abused as children by Boy Scout leaders and volunteers, said the decision could affect the Boy Scouts plan and others that employ similar releases from liability.
 
The drug and the Stamford, Connecticut-based company became synonymous with the crisis, even though the majority of pills being prescribed and used were generic drugs. Opioid-related overdose deaths have continued to climb, hitting 80,000 in recent years. Most of those are from fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.
 
The Purdue Pharma settlement would have ranked among the largest reached by drug companies, wholesalers and pharmacies to resolve epidemic-related lawsuits filed by state, local and Native American tribal governments and others. Those settlements have totaled more than $50 billion.
