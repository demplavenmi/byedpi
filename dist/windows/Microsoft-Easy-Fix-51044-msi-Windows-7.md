I am trying to get from MS Support site the Easy Fix that modifies the registry in a correct way. The name is 'MicrosoftEasyFix51044.msi' but there is no link at the mentioned page. Why and where can I get the easy fix now?

If you are still facing the issue, Install the Windows update KB3140245, either through Windows Update, where it is available as an Optional Update, or download it from the Microsoft Update Catalog (www.catalog.update.microsoft.com).
 
The file is available for download in the section labeled Easy To Fix on the above-mentioned page. Suppose the easy fix option is not suitable for you, and you prefer to manually edit your computer's registry. In that case, the article also provides that information in the section "How the DefaultSecureProtocols registry entry works."

As you might already know, TLS version 1.0 is not safe anymore and should be disabled, just like SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0: if you want to know why you can either read this post, which summarizes pretty much you have to know, or recover some info regarding the three biggest attacks that managed to exploit the various TLS 1.0 vulnerabilities discovered within 2011 and 2014: BEAST, Heartbleed and POODLE.Anyway, if you have a recent version of Windows - such as Windows 10 - you won't be affected by this issue, provided you always install the OS updates through the official channels. Conversely, if you're still using Windows 7 or Windows 8, you might have to perform some manual tasks in order to get rid of that outdated TLS version: on these systems, all applications created in WinHTTP (Windows HTTP Services) such as MS Outlook, MS Word, and the likes will use TLS 1.0 support, which is the default encryption standard for these OSes. As a result, if you attempt to establish a secure connection from your Outlook client to a "TLS secured" server, there is a high chance that MS Outlook will display one of the following error messages:The server does not support the specified connection encryption type. Your server does not support the connection encryption type you have specified.Luckily enough, this can be fixed by telling your OS to never use TLS 1.0 anymore, and stick with TLS 1.1 and 1.2 by default. Here's a small guide explaining how you can do that.
 
The first thing to do is to download and install the Windows KB3140245: you can do that using Windows Update, since it's available as an optional update, or manually download it from the following official website: =kb3140245This will equip your OS with TLS versions 1.1 and 1.2.
 
The next step you need to do is to patch your Windows Registry file, so that your OS will actually use the new TLS protocol versions (1.2, and 1.1 as a fallback) instead of the outdated and vulnerable 1.0 one. This can be done either automatically (with an official Microsoft-released patch file) or by manually editing the registry file using regedit or our own TLS12fix.reg file.Microsoft Patch FileThe Microsoft patch file is called MicrosoftEasyFix51044.msi and can be downloaded from this url: -us/help/3140245/update-to-enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2-as-default-secure-protocols-in-wi#easyIf you're doing this to face a common MS Outlook scenario, downloading and executing this file is all that you need to fix your issue.Manual updateIf you're an experienced user this probably is the recommended approach, since it allows you to choose which protocol to enable or not.#1. Setting the default TLS protocolsThe first thing you do is to create a new DWORD key called DefaultSecureProtocols in the following sections of your registry: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\WinHttp HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\WinHttpThe HEX value to set depends on which protocol(s) you would like to enable by default: To enable TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2, set the value to 0xA80 (not recommended- that's what you want to avoid). To enable TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 only, thus disabling TLS 1.0, set the value to 0xA00. This is the recommended approach as of today (might change in the future if TLS 1.1 becomes outdated as well). To enable TLS 1.1 only, set the value to 0x200. To enable TLS 1.2 only, set the value to 0X800.If you want to know more about these settings, take a look at this official Microsoft page, which explains everything and also adds some valuable info about the whole topic.#2. Enable TLS 1.1 and 1.2 at the SChannel component levelThe second thing to do, as explained in this TechNet article, is to create another DWORD key called DisabledByDefault in the following sections of your registry: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.1\Client HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.2\ClientAnd set a value of 0 (zero).Registry Patch File(s)If you don't want to manually edit your Windows Registry file using regedit, you can download use these registry patch files which we made, that will automatically set all the above registry keys with a single click.Download Registry Patch File to enable TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 (recommended as of 2019.10)Download Registry Patch File to enable TLS 1.1 onlyDownload Registry Patch File to enable TLS 1.2 only
 
That's it, at least for now: I sincerely hope that this post will be useful for those system administrators, power users and enthusiasts who want (or need) to patch their system to get rid of TLS 1.0 and fix this security vulnerability for good. Read the full article
 
In some cases, your Office 365 offline installation remains in trial or unlicensed mode. When you try to activate Office 365, you receive an error message. This article provides a number of solutions for solving Office 365 activation issues.
 
On the Internet, you find many articles, blogs, and forum entries dealing with Office 365 activation issues, but unfortunately, the information is not consolidated. You need to wade through multiple sources of information to finally get a solution to your problem.
 
And that is exactly where this article comes in. Here you find a comprehensive overview of all possible solutions on one page (including referrals to the original sources). In case I find other ways how to deal with the office activation problem in the future, I will update this article accordingly.
 
Make sure that the necessary services are running. One of the services that needs to run is the Network List Service. To be on the save side, check all services that are configured to start automatically and start the ones that are in a stopped state.
 
Microsoft Office 365 in all its glory uses many different domain names for its many products and services. Want to know which ones? Check out the Microsoft article Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges. In the list below, you find a consolidated overview of the domain names mentioned in the article. According to this article, the **required** list of domain names are:
 
Make sure to add the necessary domain names to your Intranet zone in Internet Explorer. The default settings in the intranet zone ensure that all cloud-based applications run with the same permissions and configurations as your internal, on-prem, applications.
In case you want to enable single sign-on to Office 365, please make sure that the Internet Explorer setting User Authentication \ Logon is set to Automatic logon only in Intranet zone or Automatic logon with current user name and password.
 
If you are still experiencing issues, it may be that the proxy settings are not configured correctly to allow for Office activation. How can you check if the settings on your proxy server are to blame? Well, Fiddler to the rescue! As stated by the vendor, Fiddler is a free web debugging proxy which logs all HTTP(s) traffic between your computer and the Internet. You can download Fiddler here.
 
Simply install Fiddler on the machine on which the activation issues occur and let it run. Start an Office application, wait for the activation window, log on and wait for the error. Now check the results in Fiddler.
 
First of all, in this example,
