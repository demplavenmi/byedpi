I'm only a Muslim (I don't believe in sects) and I was wondering whether it's true that Ayotallah Khomeini said that it's okay to "thigh" (if you don't know what that means, just google: 'thighing in Islam') females as young as babies? It's also called the Fatwa number 41409. I tried searching Google but all the results were from Anti-Islamic websites.

ما قرأته عبارة عن كتاب صغير جدا يسمى هؤلاء هم الشيعة يوجد على واجهته: جمع وترتيب: أبو مسلم/أيمن بن محمد الصيحي. مكتبة إبن باز. أما بداخل الكتاب فيقول ( الحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على من لا نبي بعده وعلى آله وصحبه وسلم... اختلف الناس في أمر الشيعةفمنهم من قال أن الشيعة أعداء الإسلام وأعداء أهل السنة ومنهم من قال أن الشيعة هم الرجال حقا و هم حملة راية الإسلام وفي هذه الكلمات البسيطة نبذة عن عقيدة الشيعة نقلناها من كتاب لأحد كبار علماء الشيعة بالنجف بالعراق السيد حسين الموسوي\_واسم الكتاب\_لله...ثم للتاريخ و هذا الرجل من كبار علماء الشيعة ولقد تحول الرجل بعد ذلك لعقيدة السنة و نبذ عقيدة الشيعة وقتله الشيعة بعد نشره لكتابه وهذه بعض مقتطفات من كتابه نسردها[أنا لن أذكر سوى الخاصة بالخميني الآن و لكن هناك فضائح غيره لن أذكرها الآن] ١) المتعة عن الشيعة: اعتبر الشيعة كل من لم يعمل بها ليس مسلما.قالوا عن النبي كذبا وزورا وبهتانا (من تمتع بامرأة مؤمنة كأنما زار الكعبة سبعين مرة)!! أبصر الخميني صبية بعمر أربع أو خمس سنوات ولكنها جميلةجدا فطلب من أبيها إحضارها للتمتع بها فوافق أبوها بفرح بالغ فبات الإمام الخميني والصبية في حضنه و نحن نسمع بكائها و صريخها....[يقول الرجل في جزء آخر من كتابه] قال لي الخميني عندما زرته في إيران بعد قيام الدولة الإسلامية:"سيد حسين آن الأوان لتنفيذ وصايا الأئمة سنسفك دماء النواصب و نقتل أبناءهم و نستحي نساءهم ولا نترك أحدا منهم يفلت من العقاب و سنمحو مكة و المدينة من وجه الأرض" اعلم أن حقد الشيعة على أهل السنة حقد لا مثيل له و لهذا أجاز فقهاؤنا الكذب على أهل السنة.) [يوجد الكثير الذي قاله هذا الرجل عن الشيعة و فضائحهم و كذلك قال غيره ممن انتقل إلى السنة]
 
What you are reading is based on a small book called [ These people are the Shia ] There is on its face: the collection and arrangement of: Abu Muslim/Ayman the sun of Muahmmad Asayhi. library of Ibn Baz. Inside the book it says (Praise be to Allah and peace and blessings be upon the Prophet and salaam on him and his family and his companions... People People disagreed on what to think of the Shias , there are those who think that they are enemies, and there are those who think that they are real Muslims and they hold the flag of Islam, and these words were imported from a book of a big scholar of the Shia from Iraq, Sayed Hussain Musawi ,and the name of thr book is [ for Allah ] He was a Big scholar of Shia and after that he turned to the sunnah and turned away from the shia, so the shias killed him after his book was published )
 
No, Rasulallah hasn't ever done this to Ayesha. When he married Ayesha, she was 9 and in that age she was fully grown. At the time of the prophet, people got fully grown fast and they marreid in a young age but they were old in brains and body. See, Amr ibn al Aas married when he was 11. Sorry, I am getting away from the question. About Ayotallah Khomeini, he is from shea. They love him alot but he is just a criminal. He raped lots of girls and even babies and he says that it is right to do so. I have read that he raped a 5 year-old girl while she was screaming of fear!!! Is that what Islam has tought us? Astaghfirullah. He also says that you can borrow your friend's wife and lend him yours!!! Astaghfirullah. What he has said isn't a fatwa, it is a balwa. You mustn't ever never take with Ayotallah Khomeini thoughts.
 
@Al Ummat thanks for your help and if I am wrong about Ayotallah Khomeini, I hope Allah forgive me. Amen. I must admit that I don't know anything about him except what is written in that tiny book. So from what I have read, he isn't a good person. I will search to know more about him inshaallah. Note: the book name (for Allah... Then for history). Jazak Allah khiran. @goldPseudo you are right. I will remember this next time inshaallah and jazak Allah khiran.

you see Shia are not the only ones that kill, people from Sunni that become shia get killed by Sunnis, so shea is not the only ones who kill, I am guessing that you already know that, I will translate this right now. And please tell me if I made error in my english.
 
The process of **thighing** (مفاخذة, *mufākhadhah*) refers to rubbing between the legs[1] as an alternative to sexual intercourse when that is not possible due to age or menstruation (an example of a fatwa permitting the practice during menstruation can be seen here).
 
The Shi'a cleric Ayatollah Khomeini (d. 1989), the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, infamously permitted this act on wives who are pre-pubescent. Permission is also found in a handful of isolated fatwas which used to be in a large Sunni fatwa database (one is still present on the site). While Ayatollah Khomeini is an important 20th century Shia figure, neither they nor he cite hadiths or classical rulings that explicitly mention doing this act to minors. As such this would not count as representing any kind of Islamic legal consensus, historic or otherwise. However, the more general permission for Child Marriage in Islamic Law has the longstanding consensus of the legal scholars. Modern Muslim countries are increasingly changing their civil laws to raise the minimum age of marriage in an effort to reduce the prevalence of child marriages. Many Muslim groups also campaign for these changes. The UN regards child marriage as a human rights violation and aims to eradicate it by 2030. The girl is vulnerable to spousal abuse and childhood pregnancy which greatly jeopardizes her health and future.
 
The Sunni fatwas permitting the practice on minors quoted below appear to be incompatible with traditional Sunni jurisprudence in which the husband is forbidden access to a minor wife until she reaches the age of majority (typically understood to mean menarchy). Reuben Levy, who was Professor of Persian at Cambridge University, writes, "No age limits have been fixed in Islam for marriage, and quite young children may be legally married, although a girl is not handed over to her husband until she is fit for marital congress. The Hanafite legal code lays down that a wife must not be taken into her husband's house until she reaches that condition. In case of dispute on the matter, between the husband and the bride's *wali*, who is her nearest male kinsmen and her guardian, the qadi is to be informed, and he is to appoint two matrons to examine the girl and report on her physical preparedness for marriage. If they decide she is too young, she must return to her father's house until she is declared fit."[2]
 
The practice is also attested to and confirmed by Sunni legal sources. Islamweb.net, one of the largest Fatwa sites on the internet that includes more than 250 thousand Fatwas, includes the following Fatwa:
 
الإجابة: فإن كان المقصود بالسؤال مفاخذة الرجل زوجته الصغيرة فهذا جائز. وأما إن كان المقصود بالسؤال مفاخذة غير الزوجة فهذا محرم سواءً كان المفاخذ صغيراً أو كبيراً ذكراً أو أنثى
 
Question: What's the ruling on thighing minors?.
Answer: If the question refers to the thighing of a minor wife by her man then this is permissible. But if the question refers to the thighing of a non-wife then it's forbidden whether it's the thiging of a minor or an adult, a male or a female.
 
The following is a Fatwa from the same website archived by Al-Maktabah Al-Shamilah library in 2009. The Fatwa on the site now no longer mentions the kissing and the thiging of a minor. The archived Fatwa says:
 
السؤال: أهلي زوجوني من الصغر صغيرة وقد حذروني من الاقتراب منها ماهو حكم الشرع بالنسبة لي مع زوجتي هذه وما هي حدود قضائي للشهوة منها وشكرا لكم؟
 
فإذا كانت هذه الفتاة لا تحتمل الوطء لصغرها، فلا يجوز وطؤها لأنه بذلك يضرها، وقد قال النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم " لا ضرر ولا ضرار " رواه أحمد وصححه الألباني.وله أن يباشرها، ويضمها ويقبلها، وينزل بين فخذيها، ويجتنب الدبر لأن الوطء فيه حرام، وفاعله ملعون.
 
A fatwa (Arabic: فتوى) is a non-binding legal opinion in Islam, issued by an Islamically qualified religious law specialist, known as a *mufti*, on a specific issue. The following is a list of notable historical and contemporary fatwas.
 
In September 1951, the mufti of Egypt issued a fatwa stating that both Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola were permissible for Muslims to drink. In order to arrive at that decision, the Department of Fatwas had the Ministry of Public Health analyze the composition of the two drinks. As they did not find the pepsin or any narcotic or alcoholic substances to be present, nor any "microbes harmful to health", the mufti found that it was not forbidden under Islamic law.[9]
