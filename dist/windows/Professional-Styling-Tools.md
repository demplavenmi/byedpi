I've been looking to upgrade and/or invest in some quality hot hair tools but have not purchased some of the basics in ages... leaving me feeling a bit out of the loop of where I should be looking. Particularly looking to replace my hair dryer ASAP and am open to replacing my hair straightener and finally investing in a proper curling iron (my current straightener is not great at creating curls). Some brands I've been looking at recently have been L'Ange and Babyliss Pro due to being spotlighted by ULTA. Would like to hear which, if any, of these brands those on the BIC currently own or has owned in the past? I'm looking to invest into some quality tools in the near future that I can ideally use and love for the next decade, I'm willing to pay a higher price if it ensures an overall higher performance or quality of the product. Please share, what is your go-to brand and tool for your hair styling needs?
 
@gonerogue That's the same concern I have, my hair is a bit unruly as it is and I'm not sure how the Dyson attachments would perform. The versatility of the attachments is what draws me into wanting to try it in the first place, so the thought of it not working out would be very disappointing especially for the price point. Have friends who swear by it but they have hair that is extremely easy to style and holds well and that's unfortunately just not the category I fall into.
 
The T3 series caught my attention a while ago when it dropped for the ULTA 21 Days, but I ended up passing on it back then, but the changing barrels look amazing and honestly their curlers look very intriguing. However, the straightener I'd definitely pass on with the one setting. I ended up purchasing the pictured Babyliss dryers during the ULTA sale and I also impulse bought the 1.25" vented straightener from them since I'm not very happy with the performance of my old CHI. So sorry to hear about your curler you're definitely right, not the best timing when you're out traveling.
 
I definitely agree with you, had hot tools from Conair, L'Oreal, Revlon that would last forever and has amazing results for $20-$50, sadly it doesn't seem like they make the economically friendly tools as high quality as they previously were any more.
 
@gonerogue Definitely will look into some of the L'Ange curlers espeically since I think they'll be rolling back around during Black Friday the next upcoming week at ULTA. It's a bummer you didn't like yours from T3 that much because that seemed super interesting (the interchangeable barrels) but I guess not everything that glitters is gold, haha.
 
The DryBar brush looks amazing, might be a silly question but can you use it on wet hair? I currently have something that looks similar (cheap brand, not sure what exactly to be honest) but it's less of a blow dry brush and more of a curler-brush shaped type of tool. It cannot be used on wet hair and despite saying it's suitable for damp hair the only time I tried, it made me too nervous to fully go through with the job. Will definitely be looking more into that DryBar blow dryer brush
 
I do love my Air Wrap and would suggest it to anyone as a great tool, especially with the dryer attachment. as it can be a one and done tool for me, the dryer works almost just as fast as a full on hair dryer. Hope some of this helps!
 
@missjeanie Thank you for your response and some great information I love the idea of the Dyson AirWrap but I'm very nervous how it would ultimately perform and/or hold up on my hair type. Maybe I could try using one from a friend at some point in the future before taking the plunge and ultimately weigh out if it's worth the price point for hair. I used to own a curling iron (not sure what kind or what happened to it, but it was certainly not fancy) about 3-ish years ago it somehow got legs and walked away I transferred to doing my curls with a straightener but it never quite looked as good as the curler, however it did a "good enough" job. Enough that I forgot about the curler for a while but would love to actually replace that soon.
 
I ended up caving last minute and taking advantage of the early Black Friday ULTA sales, the additional $20 off coupon and rewards point to snag a new dryer + vented straightener from Babyliss. Fingers crossed they work well, I'm most excited to try out the dryer since the one I'm convinced the one I own currently is a borderline fire hazard.
 
@QueenMarceline Oh I'm excited to hear how the new ones work out for you! I feel like hair tools were something I always let get way too run down before replacing. An Airwrap is a big investment would be great if you can test drive one first, but honestly... while I do love mine, I still question spending that much on it. I've tried to do curls with a flat iron a few times... never could get the hang of it, so I'm very jealous you could use one for curls so much.
 
@makeitup305 Thanks so much for this great info Totally agree about the Dyson, if anything I'd use my points but I'd want to give it a try first since I'm not sure about the return policy when it comes to points at ULTA. I snoozed on the L'Ange (thought it would be going on for a little longer) but I did end up grabbing a couple goodies last minute from Babyliss (combo of points, the ongoing sale and $20 off coupons). Hoping they end up good and if I don't like them I'll give them to my mom since she's in the market herself for some hot tools in the near future. I saw the T3 a few years back at ULTA when they had all separate ends you can buy for it, it seems (at least over at ULTA) that they don't sell them individually any more. Kind of regret I didn't spring for it then
