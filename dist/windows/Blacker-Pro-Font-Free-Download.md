Design details have been fine-tuned in two subfamilies: the display variant offers tighter kerning, higher contrast and sharper corners for maximum effect at big sizes, while the text variant offers better readability and screen rendering with lower contrast. Each subfamily comes in six weights from light to heavy, with matching true italics, for a full range of editorial and advertising uses.
 
Blacker features an extended character set that covers over seventy languages using the latin alphabet, as well as Russian Cyrillic. Open type features include small caps, four sets of figures, fractions, superior & inferior figures, alternate forms and discretionary ligatures.

Due to the high contrast in the design - slightly reminiscent of Didone typefaces - Blacker has been developed in two optical subfamilies. The display version offers tighter tracking, higher contrast and sharper corners for maximum effect at big sizes, while the text variant offers better readability and screen rendering at smaller sizes, with lower contrast and looser spacing.
 
In the pro version, two additional condensed variant families have been added (condensed display and condensed text) allowing for more freedom and versatility in typesetting where space constraints are present. Also, three titling uppercase-only variants have been added, with a slightly extended feel, and two decorative subfamilies (inline and diamond).
 
Each of these seven variants has been developed in six weights from light to heavy, with matching italics, for a total of 69 styles covering a wide range of editorial and advertising uses. All Blacker Pro feature a revised and extended character set covering over two hundred languages using the latin, cyrillic and greek alphabets. Open type features include small caps, positional numerals, fractions, superior & inferior figures, alternate forms, and an extended set of standard and discretionary ligatures.
 
The display version has more precise tracking, higher contrast, and sharper corners to deliver the best results when used at large sizes; text versions have higher readability, screen rendering at tiny sizes, lower contrast, and looser lettering compared to display fonts.
 
Seemingly subtle, the university typographic treatments can build both consistency and visual interest across our brand environment. UNI uses two primary typefaces and a secondary typeface to bring character, personality and expression to our work, all while reinforcing our brand identity.
 
Our primary sans-serif typeface is Proxima Nova. It combines the legibility of a clear, strong sans with the modernity of a newer geometric face. Performing well across print and digital platforms, Proxima Nova serves as a bold, versatile font option to create a wide-range of creative solutions.
 
Bookmania is the primary serif typeface for UNI. It combines the sturdy elegance of the original Bookman Oldstyle with the energy of later Bookman designs. The broad range of weights make it ideal for both text and display use. It is classic and professional, serving as an ideal font choice for a broad range of creative projects in academia.
 
With its bold personality and distinct features, Blacker Pro Display was selected as a secondary typeface option for UNI. Balanced by its modern yet classic appearance, Blacker Pro Display will provide exciting and creative solutions for accent and graphical text treatments. As a secondary typeface it should only be used minimally and strategically, so as not to overwhelm the composition. Blacker Pro Display should never be used for body text.
 
Background: Seems to me that software developers find that gray fonts are easier on the eyes, but in fact makes it harder to read for many of us, especially if the grey fonts are against a darker grey or grey blue background.
 
Problem: I have a hard time with gray fonts in email messages and application menu drop downs. I have been struggling with this for many years and decided to see if there were any solutions or registry tweaks.
 
I have tried increasing the font size, ie DPI, which is a little helpful. But still this method only makes the greyish fonts larger and not blacker. Plus i have discovered that increasing the DPI also increases the Desktop Icons and the Gadgets. God only knows why I need bigger icons and bigger gadgets when they are pretty clear in the normal sizes.
 
I have tried looking into the options / settings for applications, like Word and Thunderbird. And though changing the scheme color is provided, there is nothing to tweak the application fonts to black.
 
For MS Office programs, you can change the default font. In Outlook 2010, go to File > Options > Mail > Stationary. You can choose the font for plain text messages. Then read everything in plain text, or switch as needed.
 
thanks for your response. i eventually did find the windows colors setting icon and i was able to increase the size of the fonts and make them bold too. in doing so, it made a lot of things easier to see and read.
 
unfortunately, there is no way to change the colors of office 07, other than to use one of the 3 default schemes. but making the standard font larger, made it easier to see against the standard blue background microsoft has encoded in the menu drop downs.
 
in regards to email messages that are send with greyish background and a slightly darker gray font, i installed a plug
