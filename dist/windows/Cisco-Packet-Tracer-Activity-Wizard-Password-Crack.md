Cisco Packet Tracer is available free of charge to all Cisco Networking Academy instructors, students, and alumni. Please follow these instructions to download the software from the NetAcad.com learning environment:
 
Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2 provides you a better learning experience. It includes improvements for accessibility, security, and bug fixes for better software quality. Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2 is built upon Packet Tracer 8.0 and 8.1 and includes the following updates:

The Packet Tracer Activities (.pka files) contain identical instructions for all learners. Cisco Packet Tracer Tutored Activities (.pksz files) provide each learner with dynamic hints for just the right level of support, right when you need it.
 
No, previous versions are no longer supported. You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of Cisco Packet Tracer to take advantage of new features, security improvements, and bug fixes.
 
Yes. Packet Tracer 8.2 fully supports activities authored in Packet Tracer 7.3.0 and above. If you encounter a warning message, the activity was authored using a previous version of Packet Tracer and not all features may work.
 
Packet Tracer Activities (.pka files) authored or saved with Packet Tracer 8.2 can only be used with version 8.2 of the software or higher. Prior Packet Tracer versions cannot load Packet Tracer 8.2 data files; they will display an incompatibility message.
 
Please note that if a student using Packet Tracer 8.2 creates a new activity, or saves an activity originally created in a prior version of Packet Tracer, it will not open correctly in an older version of Packet Tracer. If the student submits the activity to an instructor who is using an older version of Packet Tracer, it will display an error message. The instructor will need to upgrade to Packet Tracer 8.2 to open the file, or the student will need to redo their work in the older version of Packet Tracer. To prevent this from occurring, please ensure that students use the same version of Packet Tracer for homework assignments that are being used by the instructor and in the classroom lab. We strongly recommend all students and instructors to upgrade to the latest version of Cisco Packet Tracer.
 
Yes. Cisco Packet Tracer can be freely distributed to any Networking Academy instructor, student, or alumni. This enables students to use Cisco Packet Tracer on any computer outside of class for homework, practice, and exploratory learning.
 
No. The program supports a subset of the features from Cisco devices. Packet Tracer uses simplified models of networking protocols and Cisco IOS; you should always compare your results to those obtained from real equipment. Practice on Packet Tracer is not a replacement of practice on real equipment.
 
The Activity Wizard allows users to set up scenarios using text, basic network topologies, and predefined packets. Users can create customized network scenarios and add instructional text. The Activity Wizard also includes grading and feedback capabilities that can be used to create an unlimited number of guided and exploratory learning experiences that provide immediate feedback to users. These activities can also be saved and shared with others in the NetAcad community.
 
Wireless connectivity uses a distance parameter set within each instance of Packet Tracer to establish connectivity. In a multiuser connection, the distance parameter cannot be specified, so a wireless connection is not possible.
 
Please report bugs and errors pertaining to Cisco Packet Tracer Activities to the Global Support Desk. To access the Support Desk, log in to Cisco NetAcad.com and click Help at the top of the page, then select NetAcad Support.
 
To collaborate with other instructors, join the Cisco Packet Tracer Community discussion. To access the communities, log in to Cisco NetAcad.com and click Help at the top of the page, then select Community Forums. This will open the Networking Academy community page where you can join the Cisco Packet Tracer community.
 
For CCNA 7.0.2, Cisco Packet Tracer 8.0.1 **64-bit** is the minimum version for new activities and new PTSA to work properly. Due to the extensive set of graphics included, the Exploration scenarios activities may experience performance issues in Cisco Packet Tracer 32-bit version.
 
The minimum system requirements allow for the basic use of Cisco Packet Tracer in creating small to medium-size networks. It is recommended that you use a faster machine with more memory to create large networks. You can turn off the Sound and Animation options to increase performance. Some screen reader software may cause a slowdown in performance, which is due to the extra processing required to query Cisco Packet Tracer for screen reader information.
 
You must place the mouse cursor over a connector of the cable, press and hold down the left mouse button, then move the mouse to an available pegboard cable slot while still holding down the left mouse button. When the pegboard cable slot becomes highlighted you can release the left mouse button and the cable will move back to the pegboard.
 
To learn more about the many Cisco Packet Tracer features, you can access the Help files (from the Packet Tracer menu) that contain comprehensive documentation on almost all the features in Packet Tracer. Plus, find the Tutorials here to learn about additional features you may be interested in. You can also join the (instructor) Cisco Packet Tracer Community where you can interact with other Packet Tracer experts.
 
Yes. The English and Ukrainian versions of Introduction to Packet Tracer course reaches End-of-Life (EOL) with last class start date of July 31, 2022. You may continue to use the existing Introduction to Packet Tracer course on NetAcad.com until then.
 
Educators may start taking advantage of the Instructor-Guided Learner Experience on Skills for All to enroll learners to the most updated Cisco Packet Tracer courses now available on SkillsForAll.com. Find the courses at -packet-tracer. Learners may access SkillsForAll.com using their NetAcad.com credentials.
 
Yes, learners should take the opportunity to enroll to the new Cisco Packet Tracer Courses to explore the latest Packet Tracer interface, see the most recent features (such as the Network Controller and the Enhanced Physical Mode), and explore the new Packet Tracer Tutored Activities (PTTA).
 
Please check that you meet the minimum system requirements. This usually results in users using Windows 7 or 8 (not 8.1) which are unsupported. You may also have an outdated graphics driver installed which may also cause this issue.
