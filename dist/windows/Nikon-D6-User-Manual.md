There is nodisrespect for all the nice folks at Nikon who have prepared the publication of theofficial manual, on the contrary, I was quite amazed after checking it thoroughlyIn comparison with many other user's manuals for older Nikon manual focus SLRs, themanual for the new Nikon camera is a vast improvement in both of its content writingand illustration. It is easier to understand, with lots of related guides on photography.It was only let down by assuming all new owners are seasoned photographers who aremigrated from older MF Nikon SLR models while on the other hand, presume most ofthem have already had a sound knowledge on fundamentals of photography and Nikon35mm SLR photographic system. Anyway, it is a tedious process to convert any cameramanual into HTML format. At least I have to confess I didn't like all the setup process(scanned from leaflets, took new images with a P&S digital camera and editing)hundreds of images just to replicate something similar like that on the network.However, you cannot expect everything can be perfect when it relates to somethingraw such a new SLR camera model, there are some gray areas which I think can alsobe improved in the original manual, that is why I am have to use an original copyas the basis to construct this section of the FM3A site and added in other informationwhich I think are also equally relative and helpful not just a seasoned Nikon user,but also for any potential buyer and/or someone who has just bought a camera withoutany accompanying reference materials on the camera itself and info on Nikon photographicsystem as a whole. Lastly, whatever it is, FM3A is a lovely camera to own and use,it is a very well made camera and I would assume in time to come, this camera mayeven good enough to last another few decades - just like the old workhorse of FM/FM2(n)camera bodies. Sooner or later, content built here will eventually benefits someoneout there, whatever the reasons.
 
I am NOT aspecialist of the Nikon 35mm SLR photographic system. The added content here arewithin the best capacity of my knowledge. Naturally, if there are any discrepanciesarising from the content ported here in this site, Nikon's own version of the InstructionManual should always be the correct guide whenever technical issues relates.
 
**Note**: Most of the content appearedin this site is largely based on a copy of an original Nikon FM3A Instruction Manualto construct. Again, a warm reminder, please DON'T mail me asking if there is a PDFcopy as there is none available in my site (just hate to see my previous manual createdbeing sold at Ebay and/or CD). The best option is to bookmark this site (or printthem into hard copies via a printer or just saved those pages to your hard disk.If you seriously think you cannot live without an original user's manual, you maywrite to Nikon US / Japan or seeking via third party used manual outlets such aswww.craigcamera.com or www.manual2go.com which might be retailing reprints, photocopiesor original between USD6-00-20-00 a copy. Update(.1.05.2205):4 years after this site has gone live, Nikon Singapore has eventually added **an instruction manual inPDF copy for download**(2.4MB). IF you prefer the factorymanual, that is fine, but this site has added numerous additions of HOW-TO whichare not found in the standard edition of the Manual, so, just set your own preferencewhich is more beneficial.

- One of the most important things that you're going to need for this course, is the user manual for your camera. Every camera is just a little bit different. And as Nikon updates its cameras, it adds features. So if you're using a camera that's a few years old, it might look a little bit different than the one that I'm using. Or maybe you're using one that's newer than mine. Slight variations are pretty common. As such, this is why I strongly recommend downloading the electronic manual for your camera. Usually, this will be available as a PDF on Nikon's website. This way, you can have the most up-to-date information and take advantage of the search command inside of tools like Mac Preview, or Adobe Acrobat, so you can easily navigate and find the content that you need. This will help you quickly locate items such as buttons, dials, and menu settings, so you can learn the skills that we're covering and not spend a lot of time hunting and pecking, trying to find the exact location on your camera. So go ahead and download that manual, get your camera out, and if you've got a charged battery and a lens, get those, too. Let's go ahead and start.
