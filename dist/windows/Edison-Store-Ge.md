**Edison Brothers Stores, Inc.**, was a retail conglomerate based in St. Louis, Missouri. It operated numerous retail chains mainly located in shopping malls, mostly in the fields of shoes, clothing and entertainment, with Bakers Shoes as its flagship chain. The company was liquidated in 1999, though some of the chains it operated continued under different owners.
 
In the 1960s the company expanded into women's clothing and children's shoes, and later in the decade began purchasing other retail chains, starting with Jeans West. In 1970 it purchased 5-7-9 Shops and in 1972 launched the Wild Pair shoe operation. It also acquired clothing chain Fashion Conspiracy, sporting goods retailer United Sporting Goods and Handyman Home Improvement Centers. By 1973 Edison Brothers was operating 1,000 store locations. Later in the decade it purchased the men's clothing chain Oaktree, and the company was operating 2,000 total locations by 1979, and by 1983, sales surpassed the $1 billion mark. That same year, Andy Newman, nephew of Julian Edison, became president of the shoe division, and Martin Sneider, the first non-Edison family member to hold a top management position in the company, became president of the company's rapidly growing apparel division. In 1985, Newman became company chairman and Sneider became president. The company continued to purchase retail chains, including young men's retailer J. Riggings (which it obtained in 1987 from the United States Shoe Corporation[3]) and big-and-tall retailer Repp Ltd.[2] In 1990 Edison Brothers purchased 225 locations of the Foxmoor Casuals women's clothing chain, some of which it converted to its other brands.[4]
 
In 1989, Edison Brothers purchased entertainment-center chain Dave & Buster's; it spun the company off in 1995, with Newman resigning from Edison Brothers to serve as its president.[5] Under Edison Brothers, Dave & Buster's was part of the company's entertainment division, which also included video arcade brands Time-Out and Space Port and virtual reality centers Virtuality and Exhilarama.[2]
 
In November 1995, Edison Brothers filed for bankruptcy, cited a poor specialty retail environment and a bleak holiday season outlook and a plan to close 500 of its 2,700 outlets by January 1996.[6] The company sold its entertainment division to Namco Cybertainment, a division of Japan's Namco, in 1996.[7][1] It emerged from bankruptcy in 1997, but filed for bankruptcy again in March 1999 amid declining sales despite shrinking the company to about 1,500 retail locations.[8][9] In April 1999, Gordon Brothers Group announced it had won a bid to liquidate merchandise at 664 Edison Brothers locations, including 295 J. Riggings stores, 234 JW/Jeans West stores and 135 Wild Pair stores.[10] The remainder of the company was sold or liquidated.

In a 2009 memoir, Sneider blamed the company's woes on an abrupt shift in the market away from the company's small stores and private-label goods to heavily promoted brand names, too little advertising, too many promotional sales, and a paternalistic company culture that emphasized promoting from within and eschewed consultants and market research.[11]
 
5-7-9 Shops were sold to a newly formed subsidiary of A.I.J.J. Enterprises, Inc., owner of Rainbow Shops.[12] The U.S. retail and catalog operations of Repp Ltd. were sold to J. Baker, which operated the Casual Male big-and-tall chain, while Repp Ltd.'s Canadian operations were sold to Grafton-Fraser.[13]
 
In October 2012, Bakers Footwear Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing declining sales.[15] In November 2012, Bakers announced the sale of 47 stores to Aldo U.S., part of the Aldo Group.[16] A last-minute effort to confirm a plan of re-organization failed, and the company was liquidated starting in January 2013.[17]
 
The Bakers shoe brand is currently owned by Bakers 2013, which purchased the Bakers brand and website domain at the liquidation and reopened some retail locations. The company is backed by New York-based shoe company Zigi.[18] However, on December 31, 2023, Zigi declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy in New York.[19]
