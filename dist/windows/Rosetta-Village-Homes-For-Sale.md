As an elected official, I believe my most important duty is to serve you, the people of Preble County. Thus, probably the most important feature of this web site is the wide range of services that can be obtained here. Another advantage of the web site is that, unlike the County offices, web sites have no office hours. Information on the home page will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This will enable those people who cannot get to our office during the traditional office hours to access information they need.
 
As County Auditor, my responsibilities are varied and extensive. I am the chief fiscal officer for the county as well as the tax valuation assessor. It is my job to see that the funds of Preble County are spent legally and that tax revenues are distributed properly, but I do not audit anyone. The Auditor of State has that responsibility. As tax valuation assessor, I am required to have each parcel of real estate valued at market value every six years. The Ohio Tax Commissioner typically orders a statistical adjustment three years later based on actual market sales in our County.
 
Our office processes various license applications on behalf of the State of Ohio, most notably dog license, as well as vendor license and retail cigarette license. We also administer several property tax reduction programs such as homestead and current agricultural use valuation.

As the county sealer of weights and measures, I protect both buyers and sellers by maintaining equity in the marketplace and can save the average household up to hundreds of dollars each year. Gas pumps or grocery store scales are inspected to make sure you get the quantity of the product you paid for. Look for the inspection seal.
 
Lakengren has had a lot of Auditor Parcel Combinations completed in the last few months.
Although the New parcel is showing all of the lots that were requested to be combined are in fact combined.
