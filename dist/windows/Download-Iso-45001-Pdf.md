The standard establishes criteria for an OH&S policy, objectives, planning, implementation, operation, auditing and review. Key elements include leadership commitment, worker participation, hazard identification and risk assessment, legal and regulatory compliance, emergency planning, incident investigation and continual improvement.
 
ISO 45001 utilizes the Plan-Do-Check-Act methodology to systematically manage health and safety risks. It applies to organizations of all sizes and can be integrated with other ISO management system standards.

ISO 45001 is **applicable to any organization** looking to implement an OH&S management system, regardless of size, industry or geographic location. It is especially valuable for **higher-risk industries** like construction, manufacturing, oil and gas, mining, agriculture, etc.
 
Yes, organizations **can get certified to ISO 45001** by third-party certification bodies. Certification validates that an organization has implemented the standard properly and has a compliant OH&S management system in place.
 
However, companies implementing ISO 45001 can choose whether they want to go through a certification process or not. As with other ISO management system standards, some organizations choose to implement the standard in order to benefit from the best practice it contains, while others also want to get certified to reassure customers and clients.
 
Many certification bodies are accredited, which means that an accreditation body has provided independent confirmation of their competence. This may bring an additional layer of confidence for stakeholders.
 
Amendments are issued when it is found that new material may need to be added to an existing standardization document. They may also include editorial or technical corrections to be applied to the existing document.

**ISO 45001** is an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard for management systems of occupational health and safety (OHS), published in March 2018. The goal of ISO 45001 is the reduction of occupational injuries and diseases, including promoting and protecting physical and mental health.[1]
 
The standard is based on OHSAS 18001, conventions and guidelines of the International Labour Organization, and national standards.[1][2] It includes elements that are additional to OHSAS 18001 which it is replacing over a three-year migration period from 2018 to 2021.[3] As of March 2021, companies and organizations should have migrated to ISO 45001 to retain a valid certification, although ISO has extended the transition period for up to six months (to 11 September 2021) for organizations adversely affected by COVID-19.[4]
 
ISO 45001 was proposed at the ISO in October 2013. The committee ISO/PC 283, created in 2013, had direct responsibility for the standardization process.[7] At least 70 countries contributed to the drafting process.[8] Preparation and committee work lasted until December 2015. From 2015 to 2017, a first draft failed to gain sufficient approval from ISO members and was revised in a second draft, which was approved and refined into a final draft.[7] In the final vote, the standard garnered 62 votes in favour, nine abstentions and four votes against from France, India, Spain, and Turkey.[9] The standard was published on 12 March 2018.[7]
 
ISO 45001 is set to replace OHSAS 18001 over three years following its publication in March 2018.[10] BSI will formally withdraw OHSAS 18001 in September 2021, at the end of the extended migration period (due to COVID-19).[11][12] ISO 45001 uses the management system standard structure guideline Annex SL to allow for simplified integration with other management system standards, such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.[13] The International Accreditation Forum has published requirements for migration from OHSAS 18001 to ISO 45001.[14]

Occupational safety and health management systems help organizations to continuously identify and eliminate safety and health risks, reduce incident potential, comply with regulations and implement risk-reducing interventions.
 
ANSI/ASSP/ISO 45001 is a global standard for OSH management systems that provides practical solutions for worker safety. It can help create a global foundation of worker safety standards and inspections that can be used by all global supply chains, for all industries and cover contractors and subcontractors in every country that supply products into these supply chains.
 
This standard provides a framework from which occupational safety and health objectives can be effectively managed, serving the needs of those who manage, use or benefit from global supply chains. Certifying to ISO 45001 can help drive solutions for improving organizational safety performance, assessing and eliminating risk and increasing productivity.
