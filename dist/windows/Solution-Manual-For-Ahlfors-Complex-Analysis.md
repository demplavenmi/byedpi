The book Complex Analysis by Ahlfors is undoubtedly great (see in particular sections 2 and 3 of the reviews available at the link). I recommend Functions of One Complex Variable by John B. Conway together with a solution manual which contains solutions to most of the $452$ exercises given in the book.

[From the Preface]: Complex Variables is a subject which has something for all mathematicians. In addition to having applications to other parts of analysis, it can rightly claim to be an ancestor of many areas of mathematics (e.g., homotopy theory, manifolds). This view of Complex Analysis as An Introduction to Mathematics has influenced the writing and selection of subject matter for this book.
 
The other guiding principle followed is that all definitions, theorems, etc. should be clearly and precisely stated. Proofs are given with the student in mind. Most are presented in detail and when this is not the case the reader is told precisely what is missing and asked to fill in the gap as an exercise. The exercises are varied in their degree of difficulty. Some are meant to fix the ideas of the section in the reader's mind and some extend the theory or give applications to other parts of mathematics.
 
An unsurpassed reference, dealing comprehensively with both theory and exercises and thus possibly answering the above question, is surely Robert B. Burckel classical monograph [1], recently updated as [2].
In these reference(s) almost all the important results in complex analysis are proved and between each theorem/proposition/lemma many exercised are proposed, relating to them as strengthening, extensions to cases of particular interest and complements: moreover, most of these exercises have hints for their solution and each chapter is followed by a rich bibliographical section pointing the reader to original proofs and/or alternative proofs of the results in the chapter, as well as to further complements. Furthermore, the book is also clearly written and readable with pleasure.
The only weak point of the work [1] is that Prof. Burckel sadly passed away on the 10th of December 2023, leaving the second volume unfinished.
 
I liked "Basic Complex Analysis" by Jerrold E. Marsden and Michael J. Hoffman.
Each section has solved exercises presented as worked examples, then end of section and end of chapter problems.
Here is a link to the 3rd edition, mine is the second edition, 1997.

"[Needham's] highly praised massive book Visual Complex Analysis may still be resounding in the minds of those who have read it. The original approach and the numerous graphics must have left a lasting impression." -- Adhemar Bultheel, Mathematical Association of America Reviews
 
"Visual Complex Analysis is a delight, and a book after my own heart. By his innovative and exclusive use of the geometrical perspective, Tristan Needham uncovers many surprising and largely unappreciated aspects of the beauty of complex analysis." --Roger Penrose
 
"Delivers what its title promises, and more: an engaging, broad, thorough, and often deep, development of undergraduate complex analysis and related areas. . .A truly unusual and notably creative look at a classical subject." --American Mathematical Monthly
 
"One of the saddest developments in school mathematics has been the downgrading of the visual for the formal. I'm not lamenting the loss of traditional Euclidean geometry, despite its virtues, because it too emphasised stilted formalities. But to replace our rich visual intuition by silly games with 2 x 2 matrices has always seemed to me to be the height of folly. It is therefore a special pleasure to see Tristan Needham's 'Visual Complex Analysis' with its elegantly illustrated visual approach. Yes, he has 2 x 2 matrices--but his are interesting." --New Scientist
 
"Committed to the exclusive use of geometrical arguments and content to pay the price of 'an initial lack of rigour', he has produced a radically new text. The author writes "as though [he] were explaining the ideas directly to a friend". This informal style is excellently judged and works extremely well."--Mathematical Review
 
"This is a book in which the author has been willing to make himself available as our teacher. His own voice enters in a rather charming way....I recommend Visual Complex Analysis, as something to read and enjoy, to share with students, and perhaps to inspire other books in which the voice of the author is vividly present to teach and explain."--American Mathematical Monthly
 
Recently I researched many complex analysis texts for a seminar and I have to say the following: For a first-time reader, both Ahlfors and Stein-Shakarchi would be too much (except if you are a graduate student and have a good feeling of analysis). Also, Stein's book has a strange sense of "proving" for the theorems (in general, that 4 books of Stein are written in a flowing style aiming for graduate students who want to proceed fast), and also there are some things about the structure of that book (the winding number is defined very late, the Jordan curves are not defined at all and the undefined term "toy curve" is used instead). I liked these books but I don't recommend them to beginners.
 
You can go along the Bak-Newman book or Brown-Churchill (which surprisingly is available for free(?)) and has a solution manual. The latter book is more intended for physics-mechanics students so many topological aspects are omitted from the text. Also Needham's book is terrific, the only problem being its huge size. The last text is An introduction to complex analysis by Kanishka Perera, Ravi Agarwal, and Sandra Pinelas which is a well-organized readable text with solutions included, aiming for students beginning complex analysis.
 
I suggest Reinhold Remmert's Theory of Complex Functions because it has lots of examples and many illuminating historical remarks. And, if you enjoy it, you can always read later Classical Topics in Complex Function Theory, by the same author.
 
If you've already taken all your Calculus sequence (preferably taken Real Analysis, but Calculus may be enough here) and are familiar with line integrals, partials, multiple integrals, etc. then I can highly vouch for Complex Analysis (Princeton Lectures in Analysis, No. 2) by Stein and Shakarchi. I don't recommend this as being your first proof-based mathematics course though. Here's the table of contents.
 
**EDIT:** Here is an online solution manual to the book someone has made. I recommend skimming through it to get an understanding of the kind of problems you'll be required to solve in this book.
 
Some popular textbooks for learning complex analysis include "Complex Analysis" by Serge Lang, "Complex Variables and Applications" by James Ward Brown and Ruel V. Churchill, and "Functions of One Complex Variable" by John B. Conway.
 
Yes, some beginner-friendly textbooks for complex analysis include "A First Course in Complex Analysis" by Matthias Beck, Gerald Marchesi, Dennis Pixton, and Lucas Sabalka, and "Complex Made Simple" by David C. Ullrich.
 
Some advanced textbooks for complex analysis include "Complex Analysis" by Lars V. Ahlfors, "Complex Analysis: An Introduction to the Theory of Analytic Functions of One Complex Variable" by Eberhard Freitag and Rolf Busam, and "Complex Analysis: The Geometric Viewpoint" by Steven G. Krantz.
 
Yes, there are several online resources for complex analysis textbooks, such as OpenStax, which offers free online textbooks, and websites like Chegg and Amazon, which allow you to rent or purchase digital versions of textbooks.
 
When choosing a complex analysis textbook, consider the level of difficulty, the author's writing style, the inclusion of exercises and examples, and any additional resources such as online lectures or solution manuals. It is also helpful to read reviews and ask for recommendations from professors or peers.
