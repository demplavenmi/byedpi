Note: If you are a former (inactive) Valencia College student who has not registered for classes in two or more years, you must reapply for admission before you can recreate your Atlas account. Inactive students do not require an Atlas account to request official transcripts; click here for more information about requesting official transcripts. Reach out to one of our Student Support Services if you need additional assistance.
