Midnight Diner has only one main character: "The Master," a mysterious, taciturn figure who offers advice and a warm hearty dish to each of his customers. While he has a very limited menu, he always offers to produce any dish that a customer may want, as long as he has the ingredients on hand and as long as they're not beyond his skills or overly complicated. Sometimes customers will contribute the ingredients, particularly if they're a very specific craving. Because of his diner's unique opening time, he welcomes a range of customers, from salarymen to yakuza and sex workers, all of whom are united in their late-night loneliness.
 
Like the tiny, 12-seat diner that acts as its setting, Midnight Diner offers a safe haven for viewers who crave comfort food television, with a slice of melancholy. It's a lovely, whimsical anthology series that feels like sitting down with a home-cooked meal and a cozy blanket.

The recent discovery of a newborn abandoned in a tent in New Hampshire has crisis counselors calling attention to baby safe haven laws, which allow a parent to safely and anonymously surrender a newborn without fear of criminal prosecution as long as there are no signs of abuse or neglect.
 
The nonprofit National Safe Haven Alliance operates a 24/7 hotline to offer confidential guidance about parenting, temporary placement, adoption and safe haven surrenders. The hotline can be reached at 888-510-2229.
 
"Anybody that takes calls has training. There's a few of us. We're social workers and pediatric nurses in the emergency departments, and we're very familiar with working with crisis," Schenk said. "And not only does that hotline provide for information about safe haven, but we're also a way to give any mom or family that's in crisis just some resources and support, too. A lot of the time, they feel like they're rushed to make the decision and they don't have a second. But giving a call, it gives them a minute just to kind of take a breath and go through different processes and options that they may have."
 
**What will happen:**The parent, or a person acting on behalf of the parent, must hand the child directly to an on-duty nursing staff member at a hospital emergency room. That staff member may request personal information about the parent and child, but the parent is not required to share those details. The staff member may also offer the person relinquishing the child an identification bracelet to aid with reunification with the child at a later date.
 
Within 24 hours of receiving a child, the safe haven staff member must notify the state Department of Children and Families, which will then take custody and initiate the legal process for the child to be adopted.


**Safe haven providers:**Maine designates individuals as safe haven providers instead of specific locations. All law enforcement officers, firefighters, staff at emergency rooms, people staffing a safe haven "baby box," and people certified or licensed in the "healing arts" (including a doctor, nurse, dentist and therapist) can take temporary custody of a child.
 
**What will happen:**The person relinquishing the child must hand the newborn directly to a safe haven provider. That person may ask for personal information about the parent and child, but the parent is not required to provide these details.
 
**What will happen:**The parent must hand the child directly to an on-duty staff member at a safe haven site. That staff member is required by law to ask for personal information about the parent and child to assist with future custody determinations and care, but the parent is not required to provide these details.
 
The safe haven site will immediately notify the state Department of Children and Families that it has received a child, which will then place the child in a foster or pre-adoptive home and initiate the legal process for the child to be adopted.

 
**Safe haven sites:**hospitals, police stations, fire stations, emergency medical service providers, houses of worship with safe haven signage, or any location where a 911 responder and the parent have agreed to meet
 
**What will happen:**The parent must hand the child directly to an on-duty staff member at a safe haven site, or meet a 911 responder at an agreed location to hand off the child. The staff member may ask for personal information about the parent and child, but the parent is not required to provide those details.
 
Within 24 hours of receiving a child, the safe haven site must notify the state Department of Health and Human Services. The department will alert law enforcement to ensure the surrender was legal and assign a social worker to initiate the legal process for the child to be adopted.
 
**What will happen:**The parent, or a person acting on behalf of the parent, must hand the child directly to an on-duty staff member at a safe haven site. That staff member may ask for personal information about the parent and child, but the parent is not required to provide these details.
 
The safe haven site will immediately notify the state Department for Children, Youth and Families, which will take temporary custody of the child. If no one has claimed to be the child's parent after 90 days, the department will initiate the legal process for the child to be adopted.

 
**Safe haven sites:**Health care facilities, police stations, fire stations, houses of worship, authorized adoption facilities, or any location where a 911 responder and the parent have agreed to meet
 
**What will happen:**The parent, or a person acting on behalf of the parent, must hand the child directly to an on-duty staff member or volunteer at a safe haven site. That staff member may ask for personal information about the parent and child, but the parent is not required to provide these details.
 
The safe haven site will immediately notify the state Department of Children and Families and local or state police agency that it has received a child. The department will take custody of the child as soon as practicable, place the child a temporary home and initiate the legal process for the child to be adopted.
 
Excision used the interview to position Subsidia as much more than a record label. Thematically and visually, Subsidia is a safe-haven city for all those who love bass. While the rest of society is sheltered in a simulated world that delivers all of their wants and needs, Subsidians have chosen to be free and are empowered to create their own experiences in the real world.

The clues are usually in the minor details, so be careful of showing things like the outside of your home or your street, your car number plate or landmarks that are really close to your home. Also be mindful that if you are broadcasting from inside your home potential burglars could be looking for weak points within your home that they can get in by. Obviously if you are broadcasting a lot of your life then they are also likely to know when you are not at home.
 
I hope that you are educated enough to know that on live streaming you literally have no idea who is watching. Like literally no idea. Do you honestly and seriously want some not very nice person getting their jollies by watching your kids on your live stream? Honestly, think about that for a minute.
 
One topic that currently falls somewhere between legal and ethical is sponsored content. This can be in the form of a product review, an endorsement or a live stream that you are paid to do from a specific location. Payment does not always mean the receiving of physical money. It can be deemed as receiving a free product, so this is when we need to act with a bit more caution.
 
Depending on where you are in the world some guidelines will fall under legal and some will fall under ethical. For the purpose of this article I am going to refer to UK laws and standards, however as more and more countries are adopting the same rules and standards I will use what I consider to be best practise for all and certainly the standard you should be using to remain on the right side of good ethics.
 
If you have paid for the products or trip yourself and it is nothing to do with the companies in question then it is not sponsored or an advert and is purely 100% of your own doing and your own opinion, then you should disclose this too. This is just good ethics and could stop you landing in trouble if your content was potentially viewed as being sponsored.
 
If you fail to disclose your position and your content is viewed as commercial usage (sponsored advert) then you could be liable to a fine and your content should be removed from the platform you have used. Repeat offenders should in theory have their accounts suspended.
 
Likewise, if you endorse a product, for gods sake be honest in what you say and have total faith in the product. If you are viewed as an influencer and endorse a product that then turns out to be the worst product in the whole wide world ever, you could potentially be liable for damages payable to anyone that believed your review and bought the product on the back of what you said. If you have any doubt at all about a product or service you are asked to work with, stay well clear. And make sure you have adequate liability insurance just in case the worst does happen.
 
There is also the financial implications of doing such work. If you are working with brands in any commercial usage way then you are in fact earning an income and this should be declared to the relevant tax authorities (HMRC in the UK). Even if you are just receiving a lot of free
