Honey Irani is the youngest of five siblings, the others being Menaka, Bunny, Sarosh, and Daisy Irani. Irani's oldest sister, Menaka, is married to the stunt film-maker Kamran Khan.[1] Her other sister Daisy, who was also a famous child-star like herself,[2] is the widow of screenwriter K.K. Shukla, and is the mother of three children.
 
Irani met the script-writer and poet Javed Akhtar on the sets of Seeta Aur Geeta. They were married on 21 March 1972. She is the mother of film-makers Zoya Akhtar and Farhan Akhtar. Zoya was born on 14 October 1972, when her career as a child star had already ended and Javed's career as a script-writer had not yet properly begun. They had no place to live, and were given a room in the house of Irani's sister Menaka. Their son Farhan Akhtar was born in 1974. Irani became a devoted home-maker, but the marriage ended in divorce after her husband became involved with the actress Shabana Azmi in the mid-1970s.[3] The couple separated in 1978 and divorced in 1985. While Akhtar married Azmi in 1984, Irani devoted herself to the care of her two young children, who were six years and four years old respectively in 1978. She started doing embroidery on sarees as a way of earning money to support her children. Eventually, she managed to make a second career for herself as a writer of film scripts. Both of Irani's children grew up to be successful filmmakers in the Hindi film industry.[4]
 
After her divorce, she started doing embroidery on sarees to support her family. Though she had been writing short stories all this while, she never shared them. She narrated the story idea of *Aaina* (1993) to Pam Chopra, wife of Yash Chopra for a TV series, but he developed it into a film. Yash had also previously asked her to develop a story idea, which went on to become her debut as a screenwriter, *Lamhe* (1991), starring Sridevi. The film saw mediocre success, but she won the Filmfare Award for Best Story for the film and it paved her way for a successful career as screenwriter. Both *Aaina* and *Lamhe* strengthened her bond with Yash who gave her his next film *Darr* (1993). However she parted ways with him after she was not given credit for her work on *Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge*. She won the award again for *Kya Kehna* in 2002, besides winning Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay with Ravi Kapoor for the blockbuster *Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai* in 2001.[3]

Now for all I know the film may have a message that somehow paints the Iranian people in a pacifistic light, emphasizing the distinction between the people and the government. But regardless, it appears that advertent or not, these filmmakers are fueling the vilification of a country by means of trailers that look like news clips.
 
That is to say, vilifying the Iranian people through reminding the public of a crisis that took place thirty years ago seems like a morally questionable act at a time when relations between Iranians and Americans are at an extremely dangerous place.
 
For Iran, nuclear energy means independence at last, looking toward France as a model, a country that gets over 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. Petroleum exports are the main source of economic surplus for the Iranian government, and abandoning the development of its nuclear power projects means risking using up all oil for potential exports domestically. No oil exports means no economic surplus for the government, a huge incentive to maintain nuclear development.
 
Though Argo features the rise of what is technically the same government that maintains power in Iran today, it also perpetuates the idea of this government as a resolute one, which emboldens it in the minds of watchers and makes it seem much more threatening.
 
But the reality of the current dynamics at play in Iran is one of great complexity that involves cleavages within the government itself. And if people continue to assume the Iranian government exists as one cohesive, strong entity, they are missing an extremely important element of Iranian state of affairs that could, almost ironically, be the key to taking down the unpopular, abusive regime.
 
At a time when waging war on this country is currently being seriously discussed by many unenlightened politicians, it is unquestionably risky to increase vilification of Iran in the minds of American moviegoers. They are, after all, citizens with voting power.
 
If nothing else, this piece is intended to remind people that every country has a dark past and, often, even a dark present, but that there are also competing perspectives and complicating factors at play that are often neglected out of ignorance or convenience. Though there is surely not malicious intent on the part of the Argo creators, they may be inadvertently helping to shift public opinion in such a way that creates undesirable outcomes.
