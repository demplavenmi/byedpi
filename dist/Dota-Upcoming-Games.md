Dota 2 is on the list of the most popular esports to play and to wager on. It features over 10 million active players and numerous betting options for fans of this game. But not everyone who decides to wager on Dota 2 knows the odds of this game and when they can enter the esports betting market to make stakes on the world's leading contests. Let's have a look at the upcoming matches and the most popular betting odds to choose from.
 
Fans of the Dota 2 game know that they can follow multiple tournaments throughout the year, but there are also annual and regional events to consider. You can check the Dota 2 upcoming matches now, but the competitive Dota 2 scene has a range of regular events that attract millions of spectators worldwide.
 
The International is an annual Valve-hosted championship with a prize pool worth tens of millions of dollars. The best teams in the world compete for the Aegis of Champions in Copenhagen. The direct invites were announced on May 27, and the tournament will happen around September 2024.
 
There is a variety of betting options in Dota 2, but all odds can be of two basic types. These are fractional and decimal odds, which are different by nature. Fractional odds in Dota 2 are so-called profit/wager odds that allow making a profit of some amount for each dollar wagered. The most popular scenario is 6/1 where bettors get six times higher profit in comparison with the bet amount. If the wager is included, for every $1 wagered, they get $7.
 
Decimal odds usually look like 2.45 or 1.40. In fact, these are multipliers that work for correct predictions. If you are lucky to guess the game outcome, your profit will increase by 145% in the first case and by 40% in the second one. For example, by betting $20 on the result with 1.40 odds, you can win $8 in total.
 
All these bet types allow you to take advantage of different Dota 2 betting odds and choose the one that can increase your wager amount. It is important to remember that you can succeed only if you stay up to date with what's going on in the esports betting markets, popular teams, tournaments, and other events connected with Dota 2.
 
In preparation for the release of Dota Underlords' first season, Valve have released a prototype Battle Pass (the aptly named Proto Pass) to all Underlords players, free of charge. The catch? No catch; they just want feedback on how it works, so they can get the Season 1 Battle Pass perfect before it's released. I don't know about you, but that sounds like a square deal to me. Let's talk a little about this Proto Pass in our **Dota Underlords Battle Pass guide**; and we'll also take this opportunity to dive into what we know about the release of **Dota Underlords Season 1**, from **new heroes** to **upcoming features** and much more.
 
The release of a new game's first Battle Pass is always an interesting subject, and with Dota Underlords Valve seem to be treading very carefully after the debacle that was Artifact last year. Let's go through everything we know about the current Proto Battle Pass, and everything we expect to arrive with the release of Dota Underlords Season 1.
 
All this sounds very familiar if you've played Fortnite, Apex Legends, or indeed Dota 2 itself. However, the key difference with Dota Underlords' pre-Season 1 Proto Pass is that it's free to all current and future beta testers. So if you've played Dota Underlords at all, you've already got the Proto Pass and the ability to unlock all these free cosmetics.
 
Of course, we can't expect this to last; in order to, you know, make money, Valve will have to put a price on Season 1's Battle Pass when it arrives. Probably something in the region of $10, as this seems to be what most other games value their Battle Pass at.
 
As mentioned previously, the two ways to earn XP to upgrade your Battle Pass Level are playing matches, and completing daily challenges (which are viewable from the main menu). If you want more specifics, these are the actual amounts you earn for these things:
 
So as you can see, if you come first in a match, you earn three times as much XP as you would if you landed 8th. And you can also see that completing the Daily Challenges provide significantly morer XP than individual matches; but of course you can complete many more matches in a day than you can Daily Challenges.
 
All this is merely a placeholder and learning experience for the release of the first true Dota Underlords Battle Pass when Season 1 arrives. **When will that be?** We don't yet know. Some are saying it might be as late as December because they're assuming a Season lasts 6 months like it does in Dota 2. But then, they also released a "Mid-Season" patch about a month after Dota Underlords was released, so it's looking more likely we'll see the arrival of Season 1 much sooner, possibly sometime in late August. But then, on the Dota Underlords Steam page it's said that the game will be in Early Access for "a few months", so maybe it'll be something more like September/October. The point is, we don't yet know.
 
All this in addition to the new Season 1 Battle Pass which will presumably sport all-new cosmetics, custom boards, banners, and more. And given how much they've been changing the already existing heroes, alliances, and other systems with recent patches, it's safe to say the world of Dota Underlords will look very
