When reading the airstart prodedure in the engine failure during flight section of the manual, I found something that Id appreciate the clarification. It mentions, "The higher the altitude, and the slower the airspeed, the warmer the starting ITT peak temperature."
 
By airspeed, I believe it is referring to KIAS (all graphs and useful data for pilots is in KIAS, at least in this manual) so no arguments there. now, we know that the higher the altitude the less dense air gets to keep up with a relatively constant KIAS, then TAS has to increase.

If TAS increased at this higher altitude, (relative to the air the plane is passing faster) and the plane is making up for the less dense air, why would we expect a higher peak ITT compared to an airstart at a lower altitude? Shoudnt be about the same peak temp?
 
Also the higher you go the colder it gets at least for a good 20,000 ft MSL which is a major portion of the flight envelope for this aircraft. (max ceiling 31,000 ft MSL). I guess getting colder air has zero impact on ITT? I appreciate the discussion. TY all!
 
So, you are correct in that IAS is the parameter that is being referred to by term "airspeed". However, I think you are confusing things by bringing TAS into the discussion. Keep the same unit of measure - if IAS increases then there will be a higher volume of air, and more heat dissipation; lower IAS means less airflow and higher ITT.
 
The reason you might get higher ITT at the same IAS but a higher altitude isn't because of TAS, it is because the air is less dense. (yes, I understand that TAS and density are related...) Air has thermal mass, and the less dense it is the less mass there is available to absorb heat from the turbine.
 
It might seem odd as cold as it is up high, but when performing environmental qualification testing of electronic equipment we often had more difficulty with heat dissipation during the high altitude chamber tests, (despite the sub-freezing temperatures) simply because the air was so thin.

I want to practice IFR approaches. Is there a way to set an air start at the beginning of an IFR approach in XP-11? If not, have people found useful work-arounds for this type of scenario? I have tried the 10nm air start, but it's a pain to reverse course (in many cases) and start at the beginning.
 
You can save a situation - that is, fly once to a specific point in space, in a particular plane and set of other circumstances (weather, time of day, speed, heading....), and then use the menu item to save that situation. then you can go back to where you were in that flight over and over for years, if you like. Just save a situation 20 miles or so away from your airport in some random direction, and then LOAD the situation to start flying from there. Of course, you need to save a separate, new situation for every "place" you want to start from.
 
For most ILS approaches, the 10-mile final is adequate (the actual approaches are 4-7 miles long). It is just about where ATC would direct you with vectors in controlled airspace anyway - correct heading, about 3-5 miles outside the final approach fix/outer marker.
 
If you want to fly "the full approach," with course intercepts, procedure turns and descents, and such - especially for non-ILS instrument approaches (NDB, VOR, RNAV) - what I do is start a 10-mile final for some other runway, or even a runway at some other (nearby) airport, and then practice getting from that random point in space to the approach I want to practice.
 
The thing is that X-Plane provides the nav radio beacons to fly IFR, but it really has no idea what an "IFR approach" is - there are thousands in the world, each one different in terms of where one starts compared to where one ends up (over the runway, hopefully). **The approach below** has at least six places where it could be said to "start," depending on where you are coming from - which one of the six do you want X-Plane to use? (answer - none - X-Plane can't read this kind of chart).
 
A regular "10-mile from runway 20" air start in X-Plane would - coincidentally - put you at ROSER, which is one of the six. A ten-mile final for runway 02 would have you lined up at the VOR to fly the hairpin procedure turn/descent back to the runway.
 
Use the IOS (instructor station) screen. Pause the sim, then put the aircraft exactly where you want it on the map, at whatever airspeed, altitude, and heading for any given approach setup (vectors to final, hold, headed towards IAF, or even lost!). That's why it's there.
 
Thanks for this topic. Some great tips that will be really useful for me as well. I'm having some issues getting GPS to ILS approaches down and each time I would end up restarting the flight from ground at the departure airport.
 
If it's hitting your FPS on your rig too hard, yep, use it prn and close when you don't need it. Local map is starting to overlap the IOS, so that too is an option for accurate acft placement for practicing APPR's.
 
Need help in changing an aircraft in an existing mission. I have tried changing the aircraft one of the missions posted in Han's DD137. It's the Landing with Calm Wind mission. When I try to land with the new aircraft, it disappears below the runway and crashes. I know I missing something with the edit. What have I overlooked or can this be easily done.
 
This sounds very odd. I wonder if its a bug. Normally you simply select the aircraft type in the airfield and save it. Then fly with no problems. Did you change/move anything else like way point or airfield or some selection boxes.
 
This is crazy! I did nothing today different from yesterday. Opened mission in ME. Selected the plane icon which opened the Plane Properties window. Selected the Plane Model button and changed the plane. Closed the Plane Properties window. Opened the Mission Properties window and changed the Mission Name and Description. Selected Save As for the new plane. Ran the new mission and was able to land on the runway...not under it. I've done this for 6 different planes with no problem...they all work.
 
Awhile back, there was a bug that occurred when a player tried to enter a plane. The plane would explode or end up underground, or the player would end up in an external view far away. A solution was to use a text editor to check in the .mission file to see if SeasonPrefix was set to blank and if so, set it to "wi" (winter) or "su" (summer, autumn). I wonder if this is a variation of that problem?
 
In the early days of commercial flight, the flying experience was harsh and uncomfortable. To even get the opportunity to fly was considered a luxury. Learn more about the evolution of the commercial flying experience in the United States using objects from the Museum's collection.
 
In the early years of flight, pilots and the occasional passenger sat in open cockpits exposed to wind and weather. Even in Europe, where large transports carried passengers in comparative luxury, the ride was harsh, loud, and uncomfortable.
 
Mostly pilots. Most early airplanes could carry only a single extra person, if any. Few passenger-carrying airlines existed, and none survived for very long. Those that did catered to wealthy travelers who could afford the expensive ticket prices. In this period, most airlines made their money by flying the mail for the federal government. Except for the occasional hop in the spare seat of a stunt preforming Curtiss Jenny for a joy ride, few Americans flew as passengers in planes, and even fewer used them as a means to travel.
 
Lt. James Edgerton flew the mail from Philadelphia to Washington during the first scheduled air mail flight on May 15, 1918. He wore this helmet and coat during that flight. Edgerton left the Army in 1919 and became the Chief of Flying for the U.S. Air Mail Service.
 
This is Lt. James Edgerton's logbook, with entries for May 14 and 15, 1918. Pilots wrote down their experiences so other pilots could learn from them. What problems did Edgerton have? How long did it take him to fly from Bustleton Field to Washington?
 
On May 15, 1918, Lt. Howard P. Culver navigated between Philadelphia and Belmont Park, near New York City, during the first scheduled air mail flight, using this liquid-filled compass installed in his Curtiss Jenny.
 
Flying was loud, cold, and unsettling. Airliners were not pressurized, so they flew at low altitudes and were often bounced about by wind and weather. Air sickness was common. Airlines provided many amenities to ease passenger stress, but air travel remained a rigorous adventure well into the 1940s.
 
Flying was very expensive. Only business travelers and the wealthy could afford to fly. Most people still rode trains or buses for intercity travel because flying was so expensive. A coast-to-coast round trip cost around $260, about half of the price of a new automobile. But despite the expense and discomforts, each year commercial aviation attracted thousands of new passengers willing to sample the advantages and adventure of flight. America's airline industry expanded rapidly, from carrying only 6,000 passengers in 1929 to more than 450,000 by 1934, to 1.2 million by 1938. Still, only a tiny fraction of the traveling public flew.
