As the makers were on the lookout for the female lead for the film, the names of Bollywood actresses Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Vidya Balan made rounds.[11] Eventually, a Russian model-turned-actress Kristina Akheeva landed the role.[12]
 
Right from the time Upendra announced of making the film, posters made by fans began circulating on social media platforms, most of which featured Upendra in costume from his eponymous prequel to *Uppi 2*. The official first look poster was revealed on 1 November 2014.[13] This was followed by numerous fan-made posters released by Upendra on his Facebook page, which were in turn circulated and received widespread popularity leading up to the film's release. The first teaser trailer of the film was released on 18 September 2014, marking Upendra's 47th birthday.[14] Alongside, fan-made Dubsmash videos and teasers were circulated and shared by the official Facebook and Twitter handles of the film.[15] The first look poster of the film's Telugu version was released in August 2015.[16] Upendra launched an official app of the film and other merchandise including T-shirts featuring the film's title logo, a week prior to its release.[17] The second teaser trailer was released on 10 August 2015. It featured Upendra doing a yoga posture, sirsasana, in the Himalayan region, and sporting the look of an aghori.[18] The cutout poster of this was unveiled by him at a theatre in Bangalore.[19]
 
Gurukiran, who scored for the prequel *Upendra*, composed the soundtrack and background score for *Uppi 2* as well. The lyrics for the soundtrack were penned by Upendra, where it also marked the reunion of Gurukiran and Upendra after 16 years. Times Music bought the music rights of the film and was produced under their label Junglee Music.[21] The soundtrack album consists of six tracks.[22] It was released on 17 July 2015 at Ruppis Resort in Bangalore. Simultaneously, the soundtrack was released by fan clubs of Upendra in around 15 districts across Karnataka.[15][23]
 
Ever since filming began in 2014, Upendra had been accused of plagiarism of the film's story, after similar accusations that followed after his previous directorial decided to take legal action against the accuser.[26] Responding to the controversy, he wrote on his Facebook page, "Deeply disturbed with all these questions about the Uppi 2 script... There is no way we will tolerate any false allegations about the script."[27]
 
A day after the release of the film's soundtrack album, on 17 July 2015, another controversy came about over the lyrics of the song "No Excuse Me Please", penned and sung by Upendra himself. It features lyrics sung in a conversation tone in the form of a monologue with rhythm, and was reported that it takes a dig at other actors including Shiva Rajkumar and Yash. The media reported the story over Upendra crediting himself over introducing machete-wielding lead actors in Kannada cinema, through Shiva Rajkumar, in his directorial *Om* (1995).[28][29]
 
*Uppi 2* received mixed to positive reviews from critics who praised its themes, cinematography and Upendra's performance, but criticism directed towards its soundtrack, convoluted plot and "abrupt ending".[36]

Archana Nathan of *The Hindu* called the film a "self-help book" where "Upendra wonders... about the concept of you (*neenu*) "unearth[ing] theories about the different kinds of people on this planet, their manner of thinking..." and handing down "some life advice." She further wrote, "Upendra theorises about three different kinds of people: those who obsess about the future, those who live in the past and finally, those who live entirely in the present. It is the third kind that he champions and practises in the film. Uppi2 wants to reform you but overdoes it."[37] S. Viswanath of *Deccan Herald* wrote, "... Upendra takes on a highly philosophical pitch while narrating a convoluted, but cracker of an action plot." He called the film Upendra's "show all the away" and added that "he goes on philosophising about the real and unreal, seen and unseen, the here and now. [the film] climaxes to an unpredictable end, you are in a tizzy, swirled and squished by the storytelling."[38]
 
Sunayana Suresh of *The Times of India* felt that it "preach[es] his [Upendra's] brand of pop philosophy, which has far evolved from the one he preached in the decade-old film *Upendra*". She wrote, "Parul Yadav's cameo is one of the highlights of the film. Upendra is at his vintage best when it comes to acting." She felt that Kristina Akheeva's casting was "debatable" noting that "she doesn't seem to add much weight to the film" with her lip sync also going "awry".[41]
 
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a diverse set of cancers that originate in neuroendocrine cells, which are cells that carry messages from the nervous system to the endocrine system. Because neuroendocrine cells are located in many organs, NETs are often heterogeneous in their symptoms and therefore difficult to diagnose. The incidence of NETs are low, but are increasing, likely in part due to increased diagnosis of the disease. Once a patient has been identified as having a NET, they will often undergo a PET scan to localize and state the cancer, which will help the care team identify the best course of treatment.

I'd like to use unicode-math to use ISO-style fonts for my formulae. However, I'd like to use \pi instead of \uppi to create an upright pi. Unfortunately, my redefinition with \renewcommand doesn't work.
