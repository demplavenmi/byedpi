The new design style offers a much better user experience while the software remains fully compatible with all versions of Windows (10, 8, 7, Vista, XP, Server both 32- and 64-bit editions). The Installation Monitor included in the program can watch all the actions that a program performs on your computer while it installs.

Advanced Uninstaller PRO can also remove a lot of items that other uninstallers don't even touch. It repairs broken registry entries, cleans non-functional Start Menu shortcuts, uninstalls annoying browser toolbars, plugins and hijackers, removes fonts and gets rid of startup programs that slow down your computer.
 
The program is especially designed to be very clear, fast, pleasant and intuitive. Easy to read information and help is readily available throughout the program, guiding you every step of the way. Advanced Uninstaller PRO helps your PC run at full speed by taking good care of the Windows registry and services. It also helps you free disk space by detecting and removing duplicate files and helping you turn on the Windows file compression if needed.

It can also defend your right to privacy by shredding the files and folders you choose in such a way that they won't ever be recovered.

Uninstalling software on Windows 11 is straightforward, but not always successful. To combat the various bits of data and registry entries that get left behind, various third-party tools are available.
 
One of these is Advanced Uninstaller PRO, developed by Innovative Solutions. Based in Bucharest, Romania, this software company has been producing Windows utilities since 2000, although Advanced Uninstaller PRO currently appears to be its only product.
 
While it has a subscription option (in the form of a Daily Health Check), which adds startup virus detection, application leftover cleanup, priority support, Windows log files removal, and Windows memory dump cleaning, the main purpose of the tool and its features can be used without this.
 
Various general tools include a Windows startup manager, easy access to the Windows services (usually accessed via the Windows Computer Management interface), and a Start Menu cleaner. There is also a Monitored Installations tool to help you keep an eye on how software is uninstalled, maintain a log, and use that log for complete removal.
 
In many ways, Advanced Uninstaller PRO is a complete Windows app and file management tool, and this is never more evident than in the selection of utilities it offers a duplicate file checker, file compression, a file shredder, and a tool for cleaning up temporary files. A collection of three registry tools is also included: a cleaner, an optimizer, and a backup and restore tool. Temporary internet files can also be removed with this software.
 
We were unable to find specific hardware minimums for Advanced Uninstaller PRO. However, the software is specifically stated as running on Windows 11 and Windows 7 through 10. It also apparently runs on Windows XP and Windows Vista and is compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit Windows versions.
 
Advanced Uninstaller has a big, bright interface right out of the Windows 98 era. Its varied tools are spread across four menus, and nothing about it is too complicated to understand. A major feature of the Uninstall Programs tool is the ability to queue up multiple uninstalls at once. This can save time if you have a long list of programs that you want to get rid of. We were able to uninstall 29 programs in a row, only needing to click a button occasionally.

By default, Advanced Uninstaller PRO runs a service in the background that watches for the uninstallation of programs. It scans for any files and registry entries left over. In practice, we found that this resulted in constant disk checking that slowed down our test machine. Thankfully, you can disable it in the Settings menu.
 
It is important to recognize that third-party uninstaller tools should all have the same basic level of functionality. The additional features and any bells and whistles in the subscription or support area are what typically set them apart.
 
Poor support options let this software suite down, and the user interface is friendlier to those fond of Windows XP. But if you can get past those issues, you will have the pleasure of using an almost complete suite of Windows file removal and data deletion utilities.

There is a page on CodeProject that shows how to write a self-deleting file, and it seems that multiple companies have decided to use that code to implement their own uninstallers. (Whether they follow the licensing terms for that code I do not know.)
 
My guess is that the DeleteFileW function was detoured in the Contoso uninstaller. When the uninstaller tried to built its table of useful functions, it ended up getting not the address of DeleteFileW but the address of a detour. It then tried to call that detour from its payload, but since the detour is not installed in Explorer (or if it is, the detour is in some other location), it ended up calling into space.
 
I actually did this. The 32 bit version builds a ROP chain and uses a single ASM instruction to enter it. All code frames are inside kernel32.dll (now kernelbase.dll) This works because in 32 bit, all arguments are on the stack so I can just return into the entry point of the next function.
 
You can create an executable file with the flag set to delete it on close, and then before closing the last handle to it, you can execute it. Then you can exit your own process, and that executable you created will be deleted once it exits too since that will close the last handle.
 
Personally I always found it easier to just start a new batch script (or perhaps PS these days) that polled the desired file into it could be deleted. But that is only for cases where I needed the file deleted ASAP.
 
I think the preferred approach is to use `PendingFileRenameOperations` to schedule the file for removal on restart. If the user opts to remove the file before a reboot then that is up to them but it will eventually get cleaned up and works as the system was intending. It is also not reliant on script settings.

Running Android apps on Windows PC has become officially available with Windows 11. However, the whole installation process is complicated and tricky even with Windows Subsystem for Android. IObit Uninstaller made it so much easier to install Android apps on Windows 11 PC. Simply drag an APK file onto the APK Installer and it will be installed automatically without any additional steps. Besides, the Android apps you installed can be quickly uninstalled with IObit Uninstaller as well.
