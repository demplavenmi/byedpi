The following are the service endpoints and service quotas for this service. To connect programmatically to an AWS service, you use an endpoint. In addition to the standard AWS endpoints, some AWS services offer FIPS endpoints in selected Regions. For more information, see AWS service endpoints. Service quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum number of service resources or operations for your AWS account. For more information, see AWS service quotas.
 
We have deployed the latest Ubuntu desktop with a full install package (all drivers, software etc..) and have managed to deploy the agent and AV via the console, however, when trying to run the AV we get the message "ESET Endpoint Antivirus Error: Cannot connect to Confd: No such device or address".

This document explains how to accessservices in anotherVPC network by using Private Service Connectendpoints. You can connect to your own services, or those provided by otherservice producers, including by Google.
 
If you've created any egress deny firewall rules in your VPCnetwork, or if you've created hierarchical firewall policies which modify theimplied allowed egress behavior, access to the endpoint might be affected.Create a specific egress allow firewall rule or policy to permit traffic tothe service endpoint's internal IP address destination.
 
An endpoint connects to services inanother VPC network using aPrivate Service Connect forwarding rule. Each forwarding rulecounts toward the per project quota forPrivate Service Connect forwarding rules to access services inanother VPC network.
 
When you use Private Service Connect to connect to services inanother VPC network, you choose an internal IP address from aregular subnet in your VPC network.The IP address must be in the same region as the service producer's serviceattachment. The IP address counts toward theproject's quota for internal IP addresses.

Create a forwarding rule to connect the endpoint to the serviceproducer's service attachment. By default, endpoints are availableonly from their own region. To make an endpoint available from anyregion, use the --allow-psc-global-access flag.
 
Create a forwarding rule to connect the endpoint to the serviceproducer's service attachment. By default, endpoints are availableonly from their own region. To make an endpoint available from anyregion, set allowPscGlobalAccess to true.
 
NAMESPACE: the namespace for the endpoint. If youspecify a namespace that doesn't exist, the namespace is created. If youomit the namespace field, the default namespace of goog-psc-default isassigned.
 
Service Project Admins can createendpoints in Shared VPC serviceprojects that use IP addresses from connectedShared VPC networks.Creating endpoints of this type is not available in the Google Cloud console. Youmust use the Google Cloud CLI or send an API request. For more information, seeShared VPC.
 
This example shows how to create an endpoint with an IP address from aShared VPC network that can be accessed from a single region. To enableglobal access, or to choose a namespace for Service Directory, seeCreate an endpoint.
 
The Service Directory namespace andService Directory DNS zone can be used by other services. Check thatthe namespace is empty before you delete the Service Directorynamespaceor delete the Service Directory DNSzone.
 
Configure systems and DNS name servers in the other network to forward theDNS names for the endpoint to an inbound forwarder entrypoint in the same region as the VLAN attachment or Cloud VPN tunnelthat connects to the VPC network.
 
If you want to replicate theautomatic DNS configuration,you can manually configure a Service Directory DNS zone that isbacked by the Service Directory namespace. After the zone iscreated, DNS entries for the endpoint areautomatically created.
 
With this configuration, if you have configured aService Directory DNS zone with the us-west1.p.example.com DNSname, and you create an endpoint with thename analytics, a DNS record for analytics.us-west1.p.example.com isautomatically created.
 
New endpoints are automaticallyregistered with Service Directory. However, if aendpoint was created before automaticregistration with Service Directory was enabled, thisconfiguration might be missing.
 
It might have this format:REGION.p.DOMAIN. For example, if theservice producer's public domain is example.com, and their publishedservice is in us-west1, then we recommend that they make their serviceavailable using us-west1.p.example.com domain names.
 
Not all Private Service Connect published services supportendpoints with global access. If you create an endpoint with global access andthe published service doesn't support it, you see this error message:
 
If you successfully create an endpoint for published services but connectivityis not established, check the endpoint'sconnection status.The connection status might indicate steps that you can take to resolve theissue.

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.
 
This specification definesthe core OpenID Connect functionality:authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 andthe use of Claims to communicate information about the End-User.It also describes the security and privacy considerations for using OpenID Connect.

In the .txt version of this specification, values are quoted to indicate that they are to be taken literally. When using these values in protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value. In the HTML version of this specification, values to be taken literally are indicated by the use of this fixed-width font.
 
IMPORTANT NOTE TO READERS: The terminology definitions in this section are a normative portion of this specification, imposing requirements upon implementations. All the capitalized words in the text of this specification, such as "Issuer Identifier", reference these defined terms. Whenever the reader encounters them, their definitions found in this section must be followed.
 
ID Tokens SHOULD NOT use the JWS or JWEx5u,x5c,jku, orjwkHeader Parameter fields.Instead, references to keys used arecommunicated in advance using Discovery and Registration parameters,per Section 10 (Signatures and Encryption).
 
OpenID Connect performs authentication to log in the End-Useror to determine that the End-User is already logged in.OpenID Connect returns the result of the Authenticationperformed by the Server to the Client in a secure mannerso that the Client can rely on it.For this reason, the Client is called Relying Party (RP) in this case.
 
The Authentication result is returned in anID Token, as defined in Section 2 (ID Token).It has Claims expressing such information as the Issuer,the Subject Identifier, when the authentication was performed, etc.
 
The Authorization Code Flow returns an Authorization Code to theClient, which can then exchange it for an ID Token and an Access Token directly.This provides the benefit of not exposing any tokens to theUser Agent and possibly other malicious applications with accessto the User Agent.The Authorization Server can alsoauthenticate the Client before exchanging the Authorization Code for anAccess Token. The Authorization Code flow is suitable for Clients thatcan securely maintain a Client Secret between themselves and theAuthorization Server.
 
The Authorization Endpoint performs Authentication of the End-User. This is done by sending the User Agent to the Authorization Server's Authorization Endpoint for Authentication and Authorization, using request parameters defined by OAuth 2.0 and additional parameters and parameter values defined by OpenID Connect.
 
The following is a non-normative exampleHTTP 302 redirect response by the Client, which triggersthe User Agent to make an Authentication Requestto the Authorization Endpoint(with line wraps within values for display purposes only):
 
The following is the non-normative example requestthat would be sent by the User Agent to the Authorization Serverin response to the HTTP 302 redirect response by the Client above(with line wraps within values for display purposes only):
 
If the request is valid, the Authorization Server attempts to Authenticate the End-User or determines whether the End-User is Authenticated, depending upon the request parameter values used. The methods used by the Authorization Server to Authenticate the End-User (e.g., username and password, session cookies, etc.) are beyond the scope of this specification. An Authentication user interface MAY be displayed by the Authorization Server, depending upon the request parameter values used and the authentication methods used.
 
Once the End-User is authenticated, the Authorization Server MUST obtain an authorization decision before releasing information to
