Fig. a on the left is a good image, while Fig. b is the distorted one because of the drift issue during the imaging. Is it possible to fix three points in both figures, e.g. A, B, C, and rectify the distortion in Fig.b based on Fig.a?

To note, if the two images (reference image and the distorted image) are of the same size (e.g. both are 2um\*2um), some of the features are not overlapping as the distorted image is a little elongated vertically. If the two images have almost the same features, the image sizes would be different.
 
This right has close links to the accuracy principle of the UK GDPR (Article 5(1)(d)). However, although you may have already taken steps to ensure that the personal data was accurate when you obtained it, this right imposes a specific obligation to reconsider the accuracy upon request.
 
If you receive a request for rectification you should take reasonable steps to satisfy yourself that the data is accurate and to rectify the data if necessary. You should take into account the arguments and evidence provided by the data subject.
 
What steps are reasonable will depend, in particular, on the nature of the personal data and what it will be used for. The more important it is that the personal data is accurate, the greater the effort you should put into checking its accuracy and, if necessary, taking steps to rectify it. For example, you should make a greater effort to rectify inaccurate personal data if it is used to make significant decisions that will affect an individual or others, rather than trivial ones.
 
The UK GDPR does not give a definition of the term accuracy. However, the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018) states that personal data is inaccurate if it is incorrect or misleading as to any matter of fact.
 
Determining whether personal data is inaccurate can be more complex if the data refers to a mistake that has subsequently been resolved. It may be possible to argue that the record of the mistake is, in itself, accurate and should be kept. In such circumstances the fact that a mistake was made and the correct information should also be included in the individuals data.
 
If a patient is diagnosed by a GP as suffering from a particular illness or condition, but it is later proved that this is not the case, it is likely that their medical records should record both the initial diagnosis (even though it was later proved to be incorrect) and the final findings. Whilst the medical record shows a misdiagnosis, it is an accurate record of the patient's medical treatment. As long as the medical record contains the up-to-date findings, and this is made clear in the record, it would be difficult to argue that the record is inaccurate and should be rectified.

It is also complex if the data in question records an opinion. Opinions are, by their very nature, subjective, and it can be difficult to conclude that the record of an opinion is inaccurate. As long as the record shows clearly that the information is an opinion and, where appropriate, whose opinion it is, it may be difficult to say that it is inaccurate and needs to be rectified.
 
Under Article 18 an individual has the right to request restriction of the processing of their personal data where they contest its accuracy and you are checking it. As a matter of good practice, you should restrict the processing of the personal data in question whilst you are verifying its accuracy, whether or not the individual has exercised their right to restriction. For more information, see our guidance on the right to restriction.
 
You should let the individual know if you are satisfied that the personal data is accurate, and tell them that you will not be amending the data. You should explain your decision, and inform them of their right to make a complaint to the ICO or another supervisory authority; and their ability to seek to enforce their rights through a judicial remedy.
 
If an exemption applies, you can refuse to comply with an objection (wholly or partly). Not all of the exemptions apply in the same way, and you should look at each exemption carefully to see how it applies to a particular request. For more information, please see our guidance on Exemptions.
 
This is not a simple tick list exercise that automatically means a request is manifestly unfounded. You must consider a request in the context in which it is made, and you are responsible for demonstrating that it is manifestly unfounded.
 
Also, you should not presume that a request is manifestly unfounded because the individual has previously submitted requests which have been manifestly unfounded or excessive or if it includes aggressive or abusive language.
 
The UK GDPR does not specify how to make a valid request. Therefore, an individual can make a request for rectification verbally or in writing. It can also be made to any part of your organisation and does not have to be to a specific person or contact point.
 
This presents a challenge as any of your employees could receive a valid verbal request. However, you have a legal responsibility to identify that an individual has made a request to you and handle it accordingly. Therefore you may need to consider which of your staff who regularly interact with individuals may need specific training to identify a request.
 
Additionally, it is good practice to have a policy for recording details of the requests you receive, particularly those made by telephone or in person. You may wish to check with the requester that you have understood their request, as this can help avoid later disputes about how you have interpreted the request. We also recommend that you keep a log of verbal requests.
 
For practical purposes, if a consistent number of days is required (eg for operational or system purposes), it may be helpful to adopt a 28-day period to ensure compliance is always within a calendar month.
 
You can extend the time to respond by a further two months if the request is complex or you have received a number of requests from the individual. You must let the individual know within one month of receiving their request and explain why the extension is necessary.
 
If you have doubts about the identity of the person making the request you can ask for more information. However, it is important that you only request information that is necessary to confirm who they are. The key to this is proportionality. You should take into account what data you hold, the nature of the data, and what you are using it for.
 
You must let the individual know without undue delay and within one month that you need more information from them to confirm their identity. You do not need to comply with the request until you have received the additional information.
 
If you have disclosed the personal data to others, you must contact each recipient and inform them of the rectification or completion of the personal data - unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. If asked to, you must also inform the individual about these recipients.
 
The UK GDPR defines a recipient as a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body to which the personal data are disclosed. The definition includes controllers, processors and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.
 
I am writing my own node for rectifying stereo images. The reason I do this is to be able to rectify/undistort only every n-th frame and also to downsample the images right at the beginning, both to reduce computational cost.
 
So far, I manage to rectify images at the full resolution and then downsample them. I suspect that first downsampling and then rectifying them would be faster, which I was trying to get to work. Looking through the code of PinholeCameraModel ros.org/doc/api/image\_geometry/html/c++/pinhole\_\_camera\_\_model\_8cpp\_source.html, it seemed to me that when I would set the binning\_x and binning\_y fields in the camera\_info to let's say 2, the PinholeCameraModel would compute the rectification map for downsampled images. Unfortunately, this gave weirdly warped images. What am I missing? What else needs to be set?
 
If binning is set to 2 from the start, rectifying the downsampled image works as you would expect it to.If you switch binning to 1, rectifying the original (non-downsampled) image works as well.If you then switch binning back to 2, you get crazy stuff.
 
I'm looking for the proper function that I can use to rectify my points, and either I cannot understand the documentation or perhaps there is no such function that I'm looking for.I will try to shortly describe you my program.The goal is to find X, Y and Z coordinates of little green balls that I'm taking the photos of. In order to do so, I use two cameras. First I made 15 chessboard photos to perform camera calibration. I do it for each camera using calibrateCamera() function. Then I undistort images with green balls using undistort(). Once that is done, I find the x and y coordinates of the green balls position on the image (coordinates in pixels). What I want to do next is to rectify those points to get canonical geometry. I'd like to rectify just points, not the whole images. As far as I know, what I need is essential and fundamental matrix. I get them by using the stereoCalibrate() function, where I pass my chessboard corners that I've already found before.So here I'm at the point that I have my 2d coordinates from both camera images, and I also have essential and fundamental matrix. And absolutely no idea what t
